a strike by a junior doctor : calling for new labour action
the representative of the junior doctor called on the coalition to approve its new labour action against the new contract dispute .
the medical association of the british medical association &apos;s primary medical committee will require its members to begin supporting more labour operations since early september .
the committee said ministers had failed to address the concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted to boycott contract deals with the british medical association in july .
of the members of the vote , 58 per cent of members of the vote were opposed to the contract transaction .
in a letter issued on twitter late thursday by ellen mcrae , chairman of the committee of primary physicians , said that the government had &quot; consistently kept silent &quot; about the issues that had led to issue of a boycott of the contract .
&quot; because of this , the commission &apos;s executive committee has voted unanimously to dismiss the proposed new contract altogether and call for a return to formal consultations on all concerns , &quot; she said .
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the commission &apos;s executive committee of the board of directors today formally asked the council of british medical associations to hold a special meeting to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour operations starting in early september .
the dispute has led junior doctors to participate in six strikes this year , including the first full-scale strike in the history of the nhs .
dr. ralph malawana , a junior doctor at the british medical association , resigned after a boycott of the terms agreed contract recommended by the british medical association .
in meetings before the poll of 54,000 primary doctors and medical students , he told the members of the british medical association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted .
after the vote , the health minister jeremy zhu said the contract would be enforced in england &apos;s health care personnel .
russia and turkey : &quot; out of the union &quot; ?
a gesture ended a crisis .
russian and turkish leaders met tuesday , shaking hands and announcing a formal end to the eight-month war and economic sanctions .
however , when vladimir putin greeted the president of turkey in a splendid hall of the palace of st. petersburg &apos;s palace , i felt a strong feeling that the reconciliation was the most desirable thing in ankara .
yes , the two sides did shake hands .
however , even as mr putin has always restrained by the standards that mr putin , mr putin is only a shallow smile , almost unenthusiastic .
according to reports , mr. recep tayyip erdoğan reportedly referred to &quot; good friend &quot; putin five times .
i can &apos;t remember .
at the same time , he promised that relations with his commitment to russia will return to pre-crisis levels and even to a higher level .
the next day , a newspaper here wrote that mr erdogan acted as if nothing had happened .
but i think his enthusiasm hints at in some of the opposite direction .
yet mr putin &apos;s continuing indifference suggests that he has not forgotten anything .
in fact , the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis : turkey shot down a russian fighter plane at the syrian border .
moscow &apos;s reaction was intense .
mr. putin lashed out at the incident , accusing ankara of backstabbing moscow .
attacks from so-called friends are more difficult to accept .
it is difficult for both parties to re-establish genuine trust .
russian public opinion has also reversed since november .
over the months , the government-controlled media had carried out a shocking offensive against ankara .
suddenly , the turks seemed to be responsible for everything .
among them , the most serious is the accusations from senior officials that mr. erdogan &apos;s family benefited from illegal oil deals in the syrian territory controlled by the so-called islamic state of syria .
he has categorically denied the claim .
however , the news from st. petersburg showed that it was time to look forward .
the meeting , after all , is the premise that mr putin has received an apology from turkish president recep tayyip erdogan .
russia can declare victory .
for ankara , the benefits of truce are obvious .
first , mr erdogan , who narrowly escaped from office after a coup last month , needed the support of all his friends .
the constant terrorist attacks have clearly dealt a blow to him .
there are also economic motivations .
russia &apos;s sanctions are a major blow to turkey , particularly the ban on charter services that can carry millions of russian tourists to the turkish coast to the turkish coast each year .
that figure has fallen sharply by nearly 90 per cent .
as the flight resumes , russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved as flights recover .
they will usher in the mediterranean tourist boom at the end of the season .
state television even predicted this week that the price of fruit and vegetables would decline once turkey &apos;s farm imports reopened .
&quot; the tourists went and the tomatoes came back , &quot; said a moscow newspaper ishemosti reported .
for moscow , the visit also has additional political value .
ankara is angry at the west &apos;s weak response to takeover intentions .
in addition , ankara is unhappy with the slow progress of eu accession talks and putin &apos;s involvement in the long term , with putin keen to exploit the political chill and to weaken relations between turkey and the west .
with the support of the elected authorities after the failed coup , the russian leadership will surely gain ankara points as a result of .
note that this is a gift for moscow , which has been deeply rooted in regime change .
as a result , the meeting held at the magnificent seaside palace made russia and turkey , two of the were rejected by the western world , and an in , as an analyst described it as &quot; incompatible . &quot;
however , despite public reconciliation , significant differences still exist .
syria is one of the key factors . moscow has played a role as a peacemaker in syria recently , while russia and turkey support the opposite faction .
predictably , after nearly three hours of initial talks , the two presidents said at a conference that the subject had not yet been spoken .
the president of turkey deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two sides , while mr putin emphasized it .
the two sides have reached a clear consensus on how to seek differences did not agree on the syrian issue .
the resumption of dialogue will surely be a good thing for the two countries to restart their leaders of the north atlantic treaty organization , which brought down a few months of public hostilities and a major disaster in nato member states .
royal bank of scotland will no longer be a customer service outside scotland
according to rbs chief executive , banks will be simplified into a logistics department .
royal bank of scotland will no longer be a customer service outside scotland .
ross mcewan told the bbc scotland division that rbs , where rbs was once committed to its global ambitions .
but eight years ago , on the verge of collapse , and it had to be accepted that the rescue , and to accept the rescue had been abandoned since then .
during that time , brand strategists used rbs to protect other consumer finance brands .
the group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events such as the football six nations by andy murray , champion of rugby six nations and the wimbledon tennis championship .
but now , the right thing to do is to make more national brands come true .
royal bank of scotland will be used for scottish clients but will not return .
in england and wales , all references outside the headquarters and the stock exchange will be changed to the national westminster bank .
the ulster bank brand has been used for clients in the republic of ireland and the autonomous region of northern ireland autonomous region .
there are also some of the other smaller , more prominent private banking brands , such as the bank of gu , adam &amp; co . , drummond and dodge &apos;s bank .
mr. mcewan was interviewed in an interview with the staff during a visit to his staff and staff in hertfordshire .
he told the bbc scotland that &quot; royal bank of scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and that it is one of the employees , because we have become a big bank with many brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became an international brand , rbs became a global brand .
at the moment , i would like to say that we are no longer focused on the world , and we have turned our eyes to the mainland .
each brand represents different industries , and our employees are customer-service through different brands .
royal bank of scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the six nations championship , while efforts have been made to upgrade the image of different brands at sporting events .
&quot; it &apos;s time to become a multi-brand bank , because we &apos;ve been looking for ways to become a better customer bank , &quot; the ceo said .
it would be ironic if we set out to be a big bank with many brands three years ago .
now we focus on customer needs , and i believe that you have noticed these changes .
i think we can restart these brands , and the time is right now .
dali , based on his predilection for the success of new yorket &apos;s career , won his 3,000 wins
the couple &apos;s two victories helped him win 3 , 000 new brunswick won a career with 3,000 wins , after which he sprayed champagne
on friday , frank tibtori , the jockey , won his 3,000 victory in new york .
he made a career 3 , 000 wins that night , with a preppy at the end of his career at the end of his career at the hands of john schumden , a trained trainer .
the 45-year-old italian is the sixth professional jockey for the milestone in the field .
the first five were : sir gordon leica , doug smith , greg smith , colin eddery and jenson .
&quot; it &apos;s special , &quot; said the three champion jockeys , who won the ghayyar victory earlier .
i was very excited because my family was on the spot too
i am happy with my achievements in newcastle , because i started from here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big race , nor is it the royal ascot jockey club , which is just an ordinary friday night with 20,000 spectators .
i am grateful and humble .
after winning the victory , he led to a series of the full cheers
in the field of accessibility , two jockeys achieved this feat , respectively sir richard johnson , champion jockey richard johnson and sir anthony mccoy , the now-retired 20 retired champion sir michael mccoy , who achieved more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career .
cooper is the ninth german champion and won 493 games in his career
dali is one of the best jockeys in the modern world , so it is not surprising that he has achieved such a landmark achievement before he has achieved this milestone , and there is not much of it .
he &apos;s stylish and muscular , but what really makes him stand out in the weighing room is his tactical sense .
he is a great equestrian ambassador , and for many years his passion and charm have attracted a lot of fans .
a few weeks ago , i told stuart in epwick that if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and a jockey , he could have been able to win 6,000 games !
it &apos;s too important for him to be sure that daly is the best equestrian winner in england in 30 years .
his lively character was a good thing for the english horse race , but besides , he was an incredible jockey .
dali is celebrating this milestone with its iconic leap down the horse
over the past two decades , dali has been a typical representative of the english flat race from jumping and jumping to jumping off .
his career is like a roller coaster .
he won a number of tournaments , including the famous &quot; seven-streak winning streak &quot; in 1996 at the royal acoco jockey club in 1996 , but he also suffered a crash and was banned from taking drugs .
three years ago , when he returned to the field after six months of prohibition , he had a great deal of strength. struggled to get back to the game. but he showed an amazing personality advantage and finally got back to the top and gave the skeptics a good .
he might not have been able to do it for too long - he had said before that he hoped to be at least 50 years old .
russian president vladimir putin dismissed sergei ivanov &apos;s office chief sergey ivanov
russian president vladimir putin , russia &apos;s president , unexpectedly lifted sergei ivanov &apos;s office of the office of president chief of staff , sergei ivanov .
for years , mr. ivanov has been a part of the core group that is deeply trusted by mr putin .
ivanov , 63 , has now been appointed as a special representative of environmental and traffic issues .
a statement by the kremlin said mr. putin had &quot; announced the dismissal of the chief of the russian president &apos;s office of russian president ivanov , &quot; but gave no reason .
anton vaino , who has been deputy mr. ivanov &apos;s deputy in 2012 , has been appointed as his successor .
mr waio , 44 , is a former diplomat .
he was born in tallinn , the capital of estonia , he graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations in 1972 and worked at the tokyo embassy .
later , he managed the presidential draft and government staff , the kremlin &apos;s website ( using russian ) .
when he was appointed , he said to mr. putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i think the most important task of the government is to support the head of the state of the state of the state to draft law and control orders .
mr. putin told russian television on friday that mr. ivanov himself asked to resign and recommended mr. valino to take over himself .
is this a convincing smile ?
moscow was puzzled by the move .
sergei ivanov has long been one of putin &apos;s closest aides , as did mr putin , working at the soviet security agency .
as chief of staff , he was one of the most influential people in the country .
on national television a meeting with president putin , both said the chief of staff was calling for his resignation .
although there was a smile in front of the camera , almost no one was convinced -- it was almost unconvincing - especially before the parliamentary elections .
so , is this the result of a in some sort of power struggle ?
it is not yet known .
but the official saying that a candidate who had been seen as a presidential candidate for the presidency suddenly chose to take over russia &apos;s environmental policy - attracting many doubts .
on the kremlin &apos;s web site , mr. ivanov was quoted mr. putin as saying : &quot; yes , in early 2012 , i asked you to give me this difficult position , even a troublesome one , for four years . &quot;
&quot; as a result , i have been the president of the presidential office for four years and eight months . &quot;
mr. ivanov held the post in december 2011 .
prior to that , he served as deputy prime minister and minister of defence .
he is a member of the russian security council , as well as mr. putin , is a former member of the national security agency .
mr. ivanov was appointed as his deputy at the end of the 1990s when mr. putin became the director of the federal security agency ( fsb , formerly the national security agency ) .
after mr. putin took office , he appointed mr. ivanov to one of the five most trusted people he trusted .
mr ivanov was once thought that mr. ivanov might to be a russian president after mr putin &apos;s second term , as three consecutive terms were unconstitutional .
but the position eventually belonged to another close aide to mr putin , dmitry medvedev .
mr. putin served as russian prime minister before resuming his presidency prime minister of russia after three and a half years in office .
the mystery of banff
one of the residents of banff found out that fish were now in his own garden and then sent for help .
kevin rubin thinks the 75 fish may be the sand eels made by a sea tornado .
mr. nichols , who lives about 500 metres from the sea , and he posted a video of this strange scene on perpepope , hoping someone could explain why these two inches of fish appeared .
the quincy bridge is now available to fife
the $ 13.5 billion project is scheduled to be completed by may 2017
engineers have linked the north bridge and viaduct of the kunses ferry bridge to the queensdorf crossing bridge , which means that the bridge has now reached fife .
the &quot; bridge fan &quot; , which is located near the three bridgeheads of the bridge , is now close to completion , and the project is the first of its kind led by a bridge .
the bridge , which started in fife , was 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 metric tons .
it used 10,000 metric tons of steel , 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 lean lasso .
the $ 13.5 billion project is planned to be completed by may 2017 .
keith brown , the economy minister , visited the scene today , became one of the first people to board the bridge .
&quot; this is a historic moment in the construction of the kunnsi bridge , &quot; he said .
we have all witnessed engineering operations on such a grand project , which was used by more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel being used in this section of the bridge alone .
although the size and weight of the bridge are enormous , the conjunction between the viaduct and the bridge-deck requires a very to be detailed and precise operation .
overall , nearly 79 per cent of the total bridge is now installed , and the concrete deck of the last section of the bridge deck is now in rosyth gate , meaning that all the bridges are ready .
&quot; it &apos;s a major milestone for the first time , regardless of the bridge project , &quot; said michael martin , a project director for construction projects at queensry bridge .
for the great project , the dragon exhibits a cutting-edge civil the skills of civil engineering technology .
to install the last section of the section is installed and connect it to the expanded north bridge road panel , it will be necessary to complete the north side or close the remaining gap on the land side .
the completion of the operation would require 700 millimetres to be transferred south of the northern elevated bridge .
this is a huge operation , and also a very sophisticated operation .
because the viaduct is 222m long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons , it needs to pull out a slope of about 3 per cent slant .
it &apos;s accurate because the engineering team needs to make sure that the deviation is very small , only a few millimetres on each side .
thankfully , everything went well .
simon bartels won the women &apos;s gymnastics championship
forget about stress .
forget about the hype .
simon balls was unaffected by all this .
the vault is full of vitality .
the balance beam is more than comfortable .
the exercise is amazing .
the overall performance was excellent .
now , it is the olympic champion .
the 19-year-old american gymnast , who won picked up a full championship on thursday , showed her talent for gymnastics at the olympic games in the olympic games .
she had a total score of 62.198 with the total number of silver medallists , aly raisman , &quot; the ultimate five groups &quot; ultimate five group , aly raisman and the bronze medalist , aliya mustafina .
simon balls , from the united states , conducted a balance beam performance on thursday in the women &apos;s all-round all-around gymnastics gymnastics women &apos;s final finals of the 2016 summer games in rio de janeiro , brazil .
balls helped the united states to achieve four consecutive titles at the olympic women &apos;s gymnastics gymnastics , who won five medals at the games , further confirming that she was the generation and probably the best gymnast ever .
she could not help but shed tears when she saw her score. she finally ended the long journey .
as a result , mr balls ranks among the &quot; decades of athletes &quot; like michael phelps &apos; &quot; for decades , and they have , &quot; they elevate their fields to new heights :
&quot; it &apos;s she has been on the best gymnast i &apos;ve ever seen for the last three years with a total of 15 medals , including 10 golds , who was the best gymnast i &apos;ve ever seen , &quot; said mary lou retton , a 1984 olympic champion .
there was a final game in brazil , but the match was not so much competition from the other gymnasts as the rivalry between her own and great expectations .
it would be a disappointment if biles didn &apos;t return to her home in springspring , texas , with a gold medal .
from the united states , simon balls ( left ) and lesman hugged each other , winning gold and silver medals in the women &apos;s all-around gymnastics women &apos;s all-around gymnastics women &apos;s final of the 2016 summer games in rio de janeiro , brazil , in august ( thursday ) .
biles won the first gold medal on tuesday and gave a surprise surprise to the outgoing national coach , paolo karolyi .
although mr balls insists that he has no plans for the future in his perennial position as a champion , it is not the case .
a section of the balls free exercise - including her signature plausibility - is latin music , which , and this music is what she listened to in the house just street away from the rio olympic venue .
this is no coincidence .
the girl who was adopted by her grandparents during a period of time visit to the gym and whose mother , aimee boorman , was found by the mother of the to have grown up , had grown into a backbone .
since the summer of 2013 , balls has not lost his hand in the all-round race , but if you want to win , she will win as long as she wants to win .
a slight lead in the rotation of musafina was an illusion .
the balance beam and the two sports gymnastics two projects , of the free gymnastics project defending world champion balls lay in ambush .
her balance beam scored 15.433 , and the free gymnastics score was 15.933 .
while he waited for the final score to come out , les gave balls a slight hug. when balls learned that he had made his dream , he left tears .
lesman &apos;s performance was a bit like revenge for four years ago , when she was tied third , but lost to mustagina in the final .
but this time this time , the american nickname &quot; granny &quot; is a far ahead of the 22-year-old was named .
she kisses the crowds after the end of the free exercise , but the return of such a return sometimes seems to be questionable .
balls was 19 years old. from earlier this week , the news has spread like a virus on twitter , and was a .
six years old , sixj brown , 36 , survived the shooting in the philadelphia shootings
police said a six-year-old boy was shot in philadelphia , the second six-year-old child in the city this week .
the child &apos;s grandparents confirmed to cbs cbs that the children shot were zabj brown .
they said there were multiple gunshot wounds to brown &apos;s groin , leg , arm and abdomen , but that the child was awake on the way to the hospital .
&quot; he suffered a lot of crime , and his little body was riddled with bullets , &quot; his grandmother , deliris melzenz told the television station .
i can &apos;t believe it .
the boy was in a critical condition at the hospital and had undergone several operations .
his family told the television station that the child was expected to recover .
he was going to start his freshman year at a local elementary school .
brown is one of four people who have been shot in the town of sderot .
two of the three others who were shot , two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old .
according to cbs , one of the 29 year-old victims was in critical condition ; the other two victims were in stable condition .
television said the child was found in the front seat of the car with the 29-year-old victim .
the other two victims were not in the vehicle , and the police were investigating the gunman in the investigation .
the investigators told cbs monitor that it looked like a number of gunmen .
a number of offensive weapons were found at the site , which could be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons .
this is no doubt a continuing battle .
there were shells on both sidewalks on both sides of the street .
&quot; so there were a number of armed men at the scene , &quot; said the philadelphia chief of police anthony kent , speaking to the television station .
there are many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area .
arrests have not yet been carried out , and the police are said to be watching surveillance videos .
on tuesday , a six-year-old child , a girl , was ejected from her shot in the arm while playing at the front of the west end community .
she is recovering and the police are still pursuing the suspect .
why we need simon , gabrielle and laurie
this is how i judged the women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team this year more than one .
first of all , since 1984 , i have been to every summer olympics , but the united states has never been so dominant .
secondly , the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts - simon balls , gabby douglas and laurie hernandez , who have always inspired many of the coloured girls .
the composition of the team was a source of pride for all is a source of pride for all of everyone feel proud because it contains the jewish ali raisman and the catholic church of madison kocian .
the team finally looks like the united states .
it also cemented the pinnacle of black and latino women in the campaign .
in the past four years , the leading female gymnast has been an african-american .
last year , simon and gabrielle were second and second .
it &apos;s so bad .
in the last olympic games , gabrielle douglas &quot; unexpectedly &quot; became an olympic champion , cheering the united states .
now , the world is able to witness three world champion simon balls , douglas and laurie hernández , who perform the routine gymnastics skills .
on thursday , simon helped the american team achieve four consecutive titles on women &apos;s all-around sports .
her teammate , ali lesman won the silver medal .
we have climbed to the top of the game , but it was not the case in the classroom teaching classroom of gymnastics .
simon , gabrielle and lorry went into the olympic team like ali and madison way to the olympic team like ali and madison .
they are &quot; the ultimate five groups &quot; because ultimate five &quot; , as the next olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnasts , which is the last year of the year .
but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and gymnasts are trained mainly in private gymnastics clubs , where their parents are required to pay for training , facilities , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( including the costs associated with coaches and gymnasts and family members ) , and the list of costs is growing .
most of the gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that provide support for the industry .
all the training of the gymnasts is completed in these clubs and is a long-term expensive expense for the families of the gymnasts .
aimee boorman , a coach of aimee boorman and elsa haney , coach of aimee boorman and elsa haney , hernandez have been coached by the gymnasts since they started gymnastics .
we have to bring more affordable , more accessible gymnastics to the young girls affected by simon , gabrielle and lorry .
twenty years ago , i founded my own gymnastics foundation .
in my organization , we offer free , low-cost gymnastics to more than 15,000 young people ( mainly black and hispanic americans ) in the black residential area , and have developed national and even world champions .
in september , we will expand to detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high-quality gymnastics to those young people who deserve this opportunity and will benefit from the great olympic sports .
gymnastics helps to cultivate the strength , flexibility and coordination of the body , and also helps nurture the spirit of hard work , self-reliance and determination .
these can bring lifelong benefits for a person &apos;s health , academic and work success .
inspired by this team , thousands of young girls will study gymnastics , which is really great .
participation is significant , especially for girls .
this is an exciting moment .
thanks to simon , ali , lorry , gabrielle and madison for the &quot; girl power &quot; in winning the olympic gold medal in the olympic group , it also thanked them for inspiring so many young girls with diverse backgrounds to open up to health , strength and success .
after the rejection of jeremy hunt &apos;s proposal , the primary doctor plans to launch a further strike
the ministers initially hoped to end the change by accepting a revised contract from the british medical association ( bma ) officials , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 primary doctors involved were opposed to the vote opposed the contract .
in july , mr. hunter revealed plans to impose a contract , saying the nhs is currently in the &quot; vacuum zone &quot; and that a slight delay would hurt employees &apos; and patients &apos; interests .
the new contract first referred to the modification of all night and weekend work practices of the junior doctors to improve the care of the irregular working hours .
last night , dr. ellen mcqueen , chairman of bma &apos;s primary committee , said in a statement : &quot; junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially if they are concerned that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and do not treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
it is only eight weeks before the first doctors sign a new contract , and we need to make progress and time is running out .
bma tries to resolve disputes through negotiations , but people are reluctant to participate and sometimes governments respond with silence .
still , last month we got the promise of jeremy hunt , who said his door was always open .
&quot; jeremy hunt now needs to take action to eliminate enforcement and to address the concerns of the junior doctors . &quot;
if he did not , the primary doctor made it clear that they were ready to take further labour action .
the last strike , which took place at the end of april , leading to nearly 13,000 regular surgeries and 100,000 appointments , as nurses and consultants were screened for doctors in the post .
the ministers initially hoped to end the change by accepting a revised contract with bma .
bma hopes to fight for better weekend wages for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract .
daniel mormons , chief executive of nhs advisers , called on junior doctors to stop any more strikes .
&quot; labour action has little to do with it , but it has put pressure on the teams and services that have already poured into , leading to worries , worries and confusion among patients , caregivers and their families , &quot; he said .
over the past two months , we have continued negotiate with the council of primary physicians and with the ministry of health and other departments to respond actively to actively responding to their concerns about the role of guardians and whistle-blowing .
employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics - such as deployment , training flexibility , other training , training costs and the gender wage gap in the course of a career , which are important for an agreement between the employer , the health education organisation of england and the gender wage differences in november , february and may .
two pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
officials have suggested promoting a $ 2 daily drug to more patients and extending the duration of the medication , after which thousands of heart patients will benefit from the drug .
anti-clotting drugs can reduce the risk of heart disease in patients with heart disease .
the drug , which lasts 12 months after a heart attack , reduces the risk of a stroke or heart attack .
the national institutes of health and clinical excellence ( nice ) , which oversees the nhs , advise patients to continue taking four years to further reduce the risk of heart vascular disease .
but now nice , the nhs regulator , recommends continuing the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease .
in england , some 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year , and a quarter of them continue to suffer from heart attacks or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances deposited in the arteries of the arteries forming plaque formation .
if the plaque breaks down , it can cause blood clots , which can impede blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .

computer culture has led to &quot; electoral fraud &quot;
lou rahman , former mayor of hammers , was sacked last year for corruption and prompted a government report .
the &quot; political correctness &quot; culture has turned a blind eye to widespread electoral fraud in muslim communities , which have been reported today by a government report .
sir eric pickles , a former cabinet minister , accused the police , electoral regulators and city hall of &quot; over-sensitivity to racial profiling and religious issues &quot; and turned a blind eye to evidence of an election .
the former minister of community affairs , the current anti-corruption minister minister of community affairs , said that the practice of intimidating voters by taking religious positions to intimidate voters was bad , and that the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling station to protect the frightened voters .
he suggested that voters carry identification documents in order to confirm their identity .
currently , voters simply give their names and addresses .
the report even suggests putting indelible ink on the fingers of voters to prevent a second vote .
sir eric said the protection of whistle-blowers should be increased .
he called for an increase in the media &apos;s understanding of the way the conference documents and the unofficial committee or working group were made decisions .
&quot; this is not just to protect against electoral fraud , but also to protect local governments from widespread corruption and the poison of financial fraud associated with close ties with them , &quot; he said .
the report was issued in downing street after the hosni hamouri election scandal in east london .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that a series of corruption and illegal acts by the deposed mayor , , of a special election court should be dismissed .
the court found that rahman &quot; grossly abused &quot; the religious feelings of the muslim community and shut down and kept silent about his accusations of racial discrimination and islamophobia .
in his campaign , mr. rahman reportedly declared that he was said to be a religious duty to faithful muslims .
as many as 300 votes are suspected , it may be that voters impersonate others .
sir eric said there is evidence of electoral fraud across the country .
in particular , he warned of electoral fraud , and senior members of the muslim community were said to have put pressure on voters to vote for the candidates they had designated .
sir eric ( pictured ) was made several recommendations on the for clearing the voting mechanism , including a good identification document to confirm his identity
he said in the report : &quot; the evidence indicates that senior members of the background , especially in the background communities in pakistan and bangladesh , are putting pressure on vulnerable groups in minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to their on their own volition . &quot;
&quot; because of the oversensitivity of racial divisions and religious correctness , they fear that state institutions will be blind to institutions will turn a blind eye to such behaviour . &quot;
sir eric proposed 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism , including a ban on the handling of voting documents by political activists to stop &quot; voting . &quot;
the report also calls for a review of the registration information to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and welfare fraud .
the recommendations included asking voters to produce identification documents before the vote .
after the vote , the voter &apos;s finger was smeared with indelible ink on their fingers to prevent a second vote .
systematic verification of the voters &apos; ethnic affiliation to ensure voting eligibility .
the active deadline for automatically mailing a ballot is set for three years .
political activists and militants are prohibited from dealing with the completed postal voting and mailing envelopes .
the police were authorized to establish a cordon around the polling station .
the amendment of the legal provisions makes it easier to terrorize individuals in accordance with the 1983 people &apos;s representatives act ( represresof the act ( represresof the act 1983 ( represresthe act .
it is illegal to take pictures at the polling stations .
only english is available at polling stations ( except in wales ) .
strengthening training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the provision of &quot; voters alone to the polling hall . &quot;
sir eric was surprised by the fact that he denounced the metropolitan police , saying that it was truly &quot; surprising &quot; that they had not made any criminal charges had been brought after the incident in hamhamshah .
&quot; there is a lot of corruption and violations and lawlessness in the presence of rahman and his electoral officers have , which have been disqualified by the electoral court , &quot; he said .
in the case of criminal proof standards , he is unquestionably guilty in many respects under the .
he also criticized the &quot; checkbox checks &quot; of the city hall election registration department .
sir eric said : &quot; last year the court sounded a wake-up call to everyone , for the duke hammers decision , . &quot;
while our country has a glorious tradition of the &quot; mother of parliament &quot; , however , but it is also a good name for some agencies to surreptitiously surreptitiously vote of the privately surreptitious electoral fraud and the subsequent kaleidoscopic rejection of the incident .

then with the knee to his groin , when the attacker bent over the pain , he reversed his gun , hit him in the face with the barrel and the backup gun , and kept his weapon on him .
if gunmen are close to the gunman approaches from the front and use a similar technique to allow , make your body not within the line of fire , take the gun and reverse the muzzle so that the gunman can &apos;t fire .

the family had been moved , and the family was said to be living in private homes
kang mcefee , the housing manager for the cornwall housing association , said she was worried that the house could not be saved .
&quot; it &apos;s a nightmare for people living here , and i don &apos;t think people can live that way , &quot; she said .
there are a lot of things to weigh now , because the house is likely to be a very good element in cornwall .
the family is notorious for its name .
the couple , who had three sons and who would live here from time to time , said their terrorist acts included fighting in the streets , terrorizing residents , drug trafficking , shouting , shouting , arguing and cursing .
in june , the 47-year-old tenant , skeldon , received an anti-social action resolution .

neighbors say they often see them fighting in the street and often the police

we lived next door for 20 years , so bad .
we have seen the police gate on countless occasions .
we were unable to sleep this morning .
we got up early because it was so quiet - we weren &apos;t used to it yet !
it &apos;s nice of them to finally go .
the family had not been able to cooperate well with the local government , &apos; says adam hendrickick , a community executive manager at the cornwall housing association .
the family lived in the house for 20 years and the police often visited
rubbish and old toys were thrown on the side of the cheap house
he added : &quot; unfortunately , the tenant did not take any responsibility for her behaviour with her family , and the eviction was the last resort of the cornwall housing association . &quot;
this is a very difficult case to deal with , because their actions are bound to horrify extremely extreme , and what they do must make the neighbors feel terrible .
i thank my team for the work i have done work i have done , and thanks to devon and the cornwall police and to the community members who bravely provide us with information .
i hope this will bring some comfort to the neighbors and convey the message that we will not tolerate antisocial behaviour .
mr. fitzpatrick said their three sons had lived in the house at various times , but said they were in their 20s .
after they were removed , a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms
the housing association workers will soon clean up piles of garbage around the house
in 2014 , the police searched the house , found 70 grams of marijuana , and found the scales , drug paraphernalia and £ 1,700 cash .
after pleading guilty , skeldon was fined for possession of drugs and drug trafficking .
she claimed that the money was used to buy a tombstone for son lee skeldon , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
it is understood that after the homeless , shin and her husband now live in a private house in plymouth .
the walls of the house were painted with graffiti .
police said they would expel tenants who defied the tenant tenants &apos; rules .

on the same day , qingdao quartet xinxin bus accessories co-zhanjiang car accessories limited also came to the annual production of 4200 new high-speed rail and motor accessories for the of the .
the project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprise and the initial discharge rights for the application is 0.0514 chemical oxygen ( lpg ) 0.514 tons / year , ammonia ( nox ) 0.052 tons / year .
the air pollutant discharge rights use and trading for the city power , thermal power and heat production of the key industrial enterprises .
existing drainage units with an eia have existing sewage unit , which has been assessed by 1 january 2016 , is not charged be temporarily withheld from royalties .
&quot; paying for the right to discharge is not the same as the power to get the of the illegal discharge , and it cannot discharge pollutants randomly &quot; he said .
huang hongyan , deputy director of the green island environmental protection bureau of qingdao , said that if illegal pollution and excess pollution still should be punished according to relevant regulations , illegal enterprises would not be allowed to circumvent penalties by purchasing the right to defecate .
in other words , through legal means to crack down on environmental violations , severely punished enterprises for excess pollution , thereby protecting the environment and safeguarding public health .
now enterprises for their own benefit , improve the anti-pollution initiative , cherish limited emission rights , reduce pollutant emissions .
with the economic benefits , reducing pollutant emissions from the government &apos;s compulsory behavior becomes the conscious market behavior of the enterprise , thus achieving the objective of protecting the environment , protecting nature and safeguarding public health .
emission rights , also known as &quot; emission rights , &quot; are the right to discharge pollutants , which means the right of emissions to environmental emissions to discharge pollutants from the environment is legally available in accordance with the government &apos;s distribution .
this right is essentially the right of the defecator to possess , use and benefit the resources of the environment .
next , in the premise that the total amount of pollutant emissions does not exceed the allowable emissions , the source of the internal sources of pollution diverts emissions through a currency exchange for each other .
the issue of sewage trading since 1968 , it was introduced by the american economist , dale dale dell , in 1968 , the united states began its application to the atmosphere and river pollution sources in the 1970s .
our pilot began in 2007 , and there are 14 provinces , including in zhejiang and jiangsu , .
according to the russian ministry of defence , in order to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes against the &quot; islamic state &quot; target of the &quot; islamic state &quot; target in syria , multi-armed russian warplanes was supported by the launch of the syrian hermiim airbase .
on 22 february this year , the united states and russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the sides of the syrian conflict , which began on 27 november .
according to the agreement , the cease-fire does not include the military strikes of a terrorist organization identified by the united nations security council , such as the &quot; islamic state &quot; . &quot;
russia will continue to build relevant military infrastructure in the base , and the living conditions of russian troops will be guaranteed accordingly .
he also said that if the extremist forces were not struck , they would be extended to russia .
while russia and the west have failed to agree on a joint crackdown on the forces of extremism , russia will strengthen cooperation with syria , iran and iraq .
in september 2015 , russia was invited by the syrian government to begin a military strike against syria &apos;s extremist forces .
on march 15 this year , russia &apos;s main military force in syria began to withdraw , but russia promised to keep the hamamim air force base heramim airbase and the naval base in tartu naval base .

china &apos;s mars project
china &apos;s mars reconnaissance mission has to be carried out around the land , landing and patrol , and this form has never been abroad .
the mission of our mars probe is to take a step around , landing , inspection , and the task is quite difficult .
since it takes 26 months for mars to reach a window , experts are working closely on plans to launch the first mars probe in the 2020 window .
according to mr xu , although our aircraft has entered deep space , it is still essential to complete mars exploration mission , which means that china is entering the era mars is entering the era of in the real sense of deep space exploration .
&quot; once every two or three years , mars has a recent chance to launch a mars probe at this point , which is the most economical for the energy of the launch vehicle . &quot;
&quot; considering the quality of the mars probe , the launch mission will be carried out by the long march 5 carrier rocket . &quot;
china &apos;s mars reconnaissance mission has to be carried out to make a landing and landing around , land , and patrol , and this form abroad , and , which has never been seen abroad , but the landing failed .
there is a lot of technology involved in mars exploration , and it is also which is unique in that the rover is a space detector , but it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detectors .
in other words , the mars probe is capable of identifying need to be able to have the ability to determine the route of the routes and find the obstacle .
researcher mark pang , a research fellow at the china space science group , &quot; said the reason why humans are so keen on mars is because exploration of mars has important scientific and technological implications , and even the future of human beings .
now mars has become the most highly studied planet with the highest degree of human research beyond earth , and humans have used space probes to carry out nearly all the history of human spaceflight .
as a result , mankind wants one day to build a living base in mars and eventually migrate to mars and turn it into the second home of human beings .
there is a great deal of evidence that mars is likely to be the same as it is today , but only after billions of years of evolution into thin atmosphere , low temperatures and water depletion , etc .
as a result , exploration or manned landings on mars could make it possible to advance a plan to prevent the earth from becoming the second mars to survive .
as of june 2016 , a total of 114 lunar probes were carried out worldwide , 43 mars exploration .
since the 1990s , however , there have been 18 mars probes , while the lunar exploration has only 14 times .
there are currently five mars orbiter and 2 mars rover vehicles working , but only one lunar orbiter and a lunar lander are working .
the world &apos;s major space-faring countries have developed plans to target the mars system , which shows that today &apos;s mars exploration is hotter than the lunar probe .
on 5 november 2013 , india launched the first mars probe , &quot; mangani &quot; and became the first country in asia to successfully explore mars .
&quot; mananga &quot; is used to study martian surface , atmospheric and mineral features explores whether there are methane and life signs on mars .
the hardest part of this task is that the probe enters the martian atmosphere and the parachute slows down only once
the mission is facing many technical challenges , according to sun ziguhou , a mars rover general designer of the mars probe , the overall division at the china space science group .
the air pressure on mars is very low , with only 1 per cent of the atmospheric pressure of the earth , with high uncertainty .
scientists have not yet been fully grasped the factors such as its change and the nature of the storm .
mars often forms dust storms similar to dust storms in the summer , which leads to a sharp drop in the sun &apos;s rays of sunlight , which must be designed to design a &quot; dormant &quot; model to patiently wait for the dust storm to pass .
at the same time , the martian atmosphere has a reduced effect on solar light , creating problems for the energy supply of mars exploration .
this requires the probe &apos;s solar wing area to be larger and needs to be constantly tuned to the sun .
also , the surface gravity of mars is only 38 percent of the earth , but much more gravity than the surface of the moon , so the probe needs greater power .
&quot; the most difficult and difficult part of the mars exploration mission is the fact that the rover entered the mars atmosphere aerodynamic shape of the martian atmosphere and the slowing of the parachute , with only one chance to ensure success . &quot;
due to the distance between earth and mars , the whole process cannot be controlled by the ground , so it must rely on detectors to complete the process , sun said .
because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed , the deceleration depends on the martian atmosphere , but the martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate .
in general , the martian way of detecting mars is similar to the way it probes into the moon , as well as &quot; around , down , around , back , &quot; and ultimately achieving the goal of manned landing on mars , says mr. horge .
since mars is far more distant from earth than the moon , the exploration of mars needs to grapple with a series of more complicated technological difficulties .
according to media reports in taiwan , the &quot; chief executive director of the executive &quot; lin announced yesterday morning that &quot; the political parties and its accompanying organizations were the improper acquisition of property handling regulations by the organization had come into effect today . &quot;
the vice president of the nationalist party said mr chiang , vice-chairman , &quot; a hundred years of history , the commitment and responsibility of society , will not fail . &quot;
mr lam stressed that the commission would be disciplined and disciplined by the , in accordance with its authority investigations of the party , an organisation or trustee , if it had violated regulations such as a political party , an organisation or trustee a ban on disciplinary action . &quot;
mr. lam also announced that he would be the deputy chairman of the committee of the cpc committee , which will be served by the deputy director of icac deputy director of integrity .
he said it was the overwhelming candidate for the committee &apos;s committee , and to borrow from mr. francis bacon in the past to investigate the relevant cases , which would be the basis for the commission &apos;s investigation of the improper party labor case .
so long as there is a communist party worker , no one will give you a social donation , and the kuomintang will be able to ask for social support and sponsorship , &quot; he said .
mr jennings also stressed that , even if the party &apos;s production was not fully confiscated and confiscated , leaving the party to zero and the party needed to start from scratch the rest would have to be pledged , allowing the party to return to zero party had not been fully confiscated and confiscated , the party to return to zero .

although it has not yet been confirmed , many sources say that apple &apos;s 2016 fall will be held in september , and the iphone 7 really coming .
although apple did not respond , the new iphone &apos;s function , configuration has been released , and even the iphone 7 &quot; real model &quot; picture .
a new generation of iphone is an &quot; all over the world &quot; , hot , hot , rich and cash-free ... if you want to buy the first time , choose a good channel , say , sunning .
this adds to the disappointment of the new mobile phone , &quot; it &apos;s longer , but it doesn &apos;t project hologram ! this generation of iphone is terrible . &quot;
the iphone 7 , like the other iphones , was preceded by countless secrets before birth .
in addition , a number of sources claim that a new generation of iphone will cancel the 3.5 mm earphone interface , with a bluetooth connection and a charging interface , which will add space to the second speaker to apple .
another evidence to support this news is that apple has allowed earphone manufacturers to manufacture headphone products that are connected to a charging interface as early as 2014 .
the news or true or false , the answer until apple &apos;s 2016 fall will be announced .
but that doesn &apos;t discourage insiders from looking at the iphone 7 - many believe the iphone 7 will likely be the last big upgrade of apple &apos;s iphone series .
the iphone market share has declined , according to data released recently by idc , a market research firm .
among them , goldman retained apple &apos;s shares &quot; buy &quot; rating , while analysts at bmo say the iphone 7 will reap a historic sales record .
meanwhile , the company &apos;s chief executive , hock wolf , also said apple &apos;s future revenue growth could be more than 20 % , thanks to the iphone 7 .
seven percent of the respondents said they had plans to buy the iphone 7 , compared with just 4 percent of the original iphone six years ago .
it is understood that 20 per cent of users currently holding the iphone 6 or 6plus plan to buy the iphone 7 , a very high percentage .
second , experts have analyzed that expert analysis , most fruit powders prefer to replace their iphone cell phones for the next generation .
according to statistics , about 26 percent of all iphone users have not changed their mobile phones for two years , meaning that nearly 120 million users have spent of the iphone &apos;s iphone has been used for two years .
according to media reports , during the iphone 7 production , which had been hit by a number of taiwan suffered a number of earthquakes , &quot; the destruction of to tsm-generating facilities exceeded imagination and could have an impact on the initial iphone 7 supply . &quot;
supply and demand can affect the average user , it is time to choose a good channel , the first time at low prices to start the original iphone 7 .
recently , su ning &apos;s , a person familiar with the matter , mr. suin has met with apple in order to prepare enough supplies , according to people familiar with the matter .
the operator has agreed have already negotiated with sunning and can foresee that with the depth of cooperation between the two sides , it will inevitably bring lower price and more thoughtful service .
&quot; at the lowest price , consumers may be able to buy the iphone 7 &quot; for $ 7 a day . &quot;
abundant supply and a variety of concessions , let the purchase of the iphone 7 no longer &quot; pressure mountain big , &quot; while su ning &apos;s logistics , it will become a more intuitive experience .
maybe you &apos;ll get a phone call in the middle of the night , &apos; hello , sunning , and your iphone 7 . &quot;

figures released by the national bureau of statistics showed that growth in fixed-asset investment and total imports in july fell .
for the national economy in july , i would like to borrow a phrase that the prime minister once described as &quot; volatile and still good , &quot; which i would like to borrow from the prime minister is better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation of in the characteristics of the economic operation of july .
he explained that &quot; volatility &quot; refers to the fact that part of july &apos;s economic growth is actually slowing down .
because the economy is still in deep adjustment in july , the international situation is so complicated and complicated that the recovery of the world economy is not expected , so export pressure is still relatively large .
from the domestic situation , the whole economy is still at the critical stage of adjustment , the pain of adjustment is released , the economy faces considerable downward pressure on the economy , so some indicators fluctuate .

gracia , who first entered the new home , was slightly shy , but soon became lively and tossed about in the basin , eating grapes with a new beak .
to remind people of the damage it had suffered , the technician did not color its new beak , but retained the original white color of the printed material .
the bird beak is a thin layer of horny sheath , inside the hollow , only some thin bone support pole row row .
although there are such internal reinforcing elements , the beak of the beak is fragile and broken when it is hurt .

in 14 years of sports , deng yaping won 18 world championships and became the first to win four olympic gold medals in china &apos;s olympic history .
she kept the world number one for eight consecutive years and was the world &apos;s first female athlete in the history of table tennis .
on september 26 , the general manager of the people &apos;s daily , was a senior official 2010 , the general secretary general deputy general manager of the people &apos;s daily and the general manager of the people &apos;s the general manager of the people &apos;s republic of china , the general manager of the people &apos;s search network , the general manager of the people &apos;s search network , a senior official .

there is also a group of celebrity coaches in the chinese sports arena : they are in an infinite state of the athletes &apos; days and have won numerous glory for the country after the retirement , and , they have won will be able to .
as the first world champion of chinese men &apos;s gymnastics , huang yubin retired to pick up the whip after his retirement .
from the women &apos;s team coach to the men &apos;s team coach and to the coach , huang yubin created a &quot; olympic gold ball , &quot; , &quot; with the myth of 9 gold and 4 bronze 4 bronze .
since then , tian liang has always been advertising endorsements , in recent years has played the &quot; cowherd &quot; and &quot; lei feng &quot; important roles .
many nba players have proved their strength , but there has been a decline in progress .
whether it &apos;s the age of age or the time is limited , there are some players in the season will be a setback for .
of course , some of the &quot; setbacks &quot; may simply be the decline of the data , and the players may not be able to do so .
even though wade is still one of the best scoring guards in the league , his performance in the bull should not be so good .
he and rondo have a limited range of backyards , and when home star butler butler &apos;s three-point strike by a is only 32.8 % , which makes them very crowded for the in the next season .
in the windy city , the flash is bound to give the right of the ball more to butler and rondo , who would probably choose to play in regimen in regular season .
he was embarrassed by his , and as the first option for 76 last season , he had to compete with simmons and the right to play with simmons and wayne in the new season .
the competition may not come soon , simmons will need to adapt to the nba game , and enbaud will have to get used to recover from injury as soon as possible , but ocafu can whether okoe will be in a position of 76 people will be a problem in the to .
in the last season , okafu 32 per cent came from a low attack , higher than cousins , vujacic and brooke lopez , while his usage was the top 40 .
as simmons has already shown the potential for a good ball forward excellent point of possession , mr ender is also has a better fit for the nba , which is likely to be hard to secure .
over the past two seasons , thompson &apos;s use has stabilized at the top 20 , and that &apos;s the best two seasons of his career .
the problem , however , is that with durant &apos;s arrival , mr thompson &apos;s usage is bound to fall , which is bound to affect his performance .
this effect will not only be the impact of the number of strokes , but the lord &apos;s ball attack will certainly be greatly reduced in the next season , which in some respects will reduce the difficulty of opponents .
durant &apos;s arrival would have shrunk the numbers of the warriors , but the worst of them would have been thompson .
but this does not mean that the level of the townsend has regressed , much more like the sacrifice he made for the team .
parker was better off last season than the data , not only because he came to the top of his career , but also to the spurs .
duncan retired , gino ginobili announced another year , the gdp portfolio finally reached the end , as the youngest of three of the three , the french sports car tank is not much oil .
after getting the third championship ring , only jabbar , jordan and russell james won more regular mvp than lebron james , and jordan was the only one to be the fmvp .
oh , yes , james just brought the first professional sports championship trophy for cleveland in 52 years .
james , who has come to the 14th season of his career , needs to be better sense of fitness and preparation for the playoffs .
so , in the regular season , james &apos;s data is likely to fall further , and he will give owen a lot more of the burden to take on , but he will still easily become the first three players in the league .

the team won the gold medal , the first ever olympic medal in the country &apos;s history , with impeccable control , breaking , dodging , matching , running and power .
the silver was a great consolation to the defeated british team , which was the third silver medal for the british delegation that day. it was enough to make the british rugby team proud : they beat new zealand , argentina and south africa in the seven-man rugby game first .
earlier in the day , the british team won a 7-5-5 win over south africa , which could affect their status in the final .
but in any case , the current fiji team will be able to defeat a spirited 15-member team .
tomorrow , at least one englishman will wear a gold medal , which may be a comfort to the british team , but it may not be the is from wimbledon coach ben ryan , who has served as a comfort to england .
it is not easy for england to achieve today &apos;s results .
eight years ago , under ryan &apos;s coaching , they did not taste the success of the international seven-man football game in adelaide .
now , they &apos;re just one step away from the championship .
although they have been hit by a great deal , they have made remarkable progress .
the opening of fiji took advantage of the opening , leaving the british team defenseless .
for tom mitchell and his teammates , it was like bumping into a string of moving buses. the world series championship team is already ahead of the of a 5-0 lead when osci collinso runs into the corner .
it was only four minutes after the game , and jerry tuckhey scored a touchdown on the right wing .
the british team had 12-0 , england barely touched the ball .
mitchell &apos;s strong intercept has left lyon , the general manager of lyon , did not score for the third time , but it only slowed the pace at which fiji &apos;s score .
in seven minutes , asa wellmalouu touched the ground in the right corner . 17 to 0 , the british team added to the pressure .
that carravara scored another point , a second , and the game was ... 1 minute left .
then walter ravovo broke through the british defence and went straight to the scoring line .
at halftime , the score was 29 to 0 .
fijians seem to have been born to play seven football , while the british were still a cub .
that is the case .
the british team made a huge change in the second half and hit fijians in the first half the fiji team played the full four solid minutes , but in the first half , it was a good performance .
dan norton gave the english team a chance to score. he landed on the left corner with a 36 to 7 , but in the control of the south china sea island , their fans sang , waved flags and sang songs .
the great performance of the fijian team had to be applauded .
matta william , at the end of the day , minute prevented the fiji team from an offensive attack .
at the end of the final whistle sounded , the fijians hug together , and the defeated british team can only leave .
earlier in the day , fiji beat japan 20 to 5 in the semifinals , while britain narrowly defeated the south africa in a semi-final semi-final .
in the first half , kyle brown helped south africa get ahead , but dan norton scored in the second half with a superb foot method .

helen graf and heather stein were inspired by the coach of cancer and won a gold medal in rowing
it is no exaggeration to say that this is the most moving gold medal .
from the beginning of the first paddles to the present , helen graf and heather stanning had accepted 220 exemplary punishments , and their gold medal in the estacio da cocoa had a more remarkable significance .
although they were only two of them , the sound of a man on board , coach robin williams , had been hit by the voice of a man the second in a row , robin williams , who had been beating the gold medal in a row by the second women &apos;s synchronized sculls olympic games .
they have maintained 39 unbeaten unbeaten records and have an absolute advantage .
what we have seen is that the two talented athletes are marching gracefully on the surface of the water , but this is not all the victory .
there is a lot of voluntary help behind each of the gold medals in rowing , and it is their constant dedication to create different , and the most of , they are to learn that there are many a 30 months ago when people who has been diagnosed with cancer and do not know whether they can live .
as he said , death could come at any time .
i had bladder cancer and they had surgery for me .
if there is no operation , the cancer cells will spread into the body if it does not operate , the .
that would be much worse .
this will change your opinion slightly .
williams was diagnosed as cancer in december 2013 .
fortunately , he started treatment in early 2014 to minimize the impact , although in such circumstances it might not be appropriate .
i need to get a salary , so i have to get up quickly .
this is an inspiration to me .
i live in the hospital , and although they say a few steps enough , but i walked 20 feet , 30 feet and 50 feet around the ward every time .
this is the beginning of everything .
rowing itself is a journey , which makes this journey a bit longer .
at the moment of gold , the first thing they thought of was williams. this morning williams was more chatty than usual in order to overcome his anxiety .
&quot; i was in a bad mood this week and maybe it was a bit extreme , but it really meant a lot , &quot; she said .
it repeatedly told me how important it was for me , and how hard it was for me , helen and robin had made .
it was helen , robin and i worked hard for three years .
if we don &apos;t have robin , we &apos;re just nobody , thank you , he &apos;s the best coach in the world very much , he &apos;s the best coach in the world for him , he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
i can &apos;t find a better trainer and coach than him .
helen graf and heather stanning did not succeed in five years .
the set of penalties for the combination is unmatched by their rivals .
even at the last 500 metres , the new zealand and denmark began to close danish teams begin to close , while stanning and graf still had plenty of physical reserves .
it was a shock .
helen barks : &quot; keep pace and keep pace . &quot;
it &apos;s really important not to be affected by your opponent .
we had a good start , and we didn &apos;t expect to do anything earth-shattering .
we didn &apos;t think of the glory of today , we just wanted to get each paddle and win the game , and we did it .
it took a year to decide their own future .
graf will marry the television explorer steve buckower next month .
but now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
i don &apos;t want to say this is my last game .
this will put too much pressure on me .
in london , it took me about six months to realize that i was an olympic champion .
this is a new experience , and i feel very nervous .
it has been about four minutes now .
&quot; i feel much better , &quot; she said .

snapleton &apos;s &quot; animation &quot; effect of snapshot is referred to as satire on asians
snapleton said the filter was inspired by animation , but some observers thought it had racial overtones .
snapleton &apos;s 150 million daily users can change reality through their filter tools and make them ridiculous .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog , or a roy lichtenstein .
these lenses have the effect of blunting and bending features , generating more than 30 million embellished self-portraits self-portraits each day .
any mistake will be instantly noticed by the public .
snapshot lenses have been criticised for promoting the role of black or white skin .
so when the app provides a filter for some users this week to create sloppers , weird teeth and powders , some critics call it a racial irony of the asian &quot; yellow race . &quot;
they even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has a bigger problem in diversity .
following the release of the feature , the coverage of the verge and countrywide report on wednesday sparked outrage after sánchez said it had deleted .
the company &apos;s explanation : the filter is a tribute to the animation role , not the irony of asians .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the filter reminds them of the stereotype of a distorted stereotype of reality .
others are firmly opposed to these comic images .
the filter &quot; is at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable , &quot; said one of the widely shared korean-american arts in an email .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to distinguish between the most disgusting asian irony and the of a filter , &quot; she added .
although the filter is not only the yellow race in the filter , the yellow race is severely devalued .
snapleton is not the only company to touch these cultural bottom lines .
from the corporate board of directors to hollywood and the equipment we carry , american culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusion from .
the vast young population of snapleton is likely to be very sensitive as a result of more racial diversity than the older generation , .
when a snapleton filter produced an insult to the user &apos;s image , zhu katy , 25 , said in an interview on thursday as he : &quot; this sort of thing is more than ever &apos;t escape people &apos;s attention is going to have to be . &quot;
on thursday , ms. zhu , a product manager and engineer at meeter , decided to remove her snapleton account and encourage others to do so .
in an article and a telephone interview for meeter , she said she believed racial controversy reflected sánchez &apos;s lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process .
ms. zhu criticized the company &apos;s employees as mostly white , the leadership was all male and at the end of the article added a label : &lt; hash &gt; deletesnapleton .
as a chinese-american , ms. chu says : &quot; there &apos;s no race among their employees , so it &apos;s a decision to make such a decision or to have some of the color of the people in their staff , but their positions can &apos;t let them talk . &quot;
other observers shared a complaint that she did not respond to .
the company did not publish data on employee diversity and said it was a private company .
on thursday snapmap declined to discuss the racial background of its employees , but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the lower share of the internal population and to promote internal inclusiveness .
ms. zhu said she would close her snapshot account : &quot; i want to know if they need more users like us against this behavior . &quot;
the congressional panel said military officials distorted the intel &apos;s intelligence
in a report released thursday , a congressional panel said officials from the central command of the united states changed intelligence reports and would be more optimistic about the war in iraq and syria against the islamic state .
the interim report comes from a special task force set up by the house armed services committee , the intelligence committee and the house appropriate committee of the house of representatives , which said the cia intelligence analysts had &quot; widespread discontent &quot; that their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the war in the of the united states and islamic state wars in the .
the central command of tampa , florida , is the military headquarters for overseeing u.s. military operations in the middle east and central asia .
according to a news report on the report , &quot; information that is reviewed by senior leaders of central command is more optimistic than the actual situation of the united states anti-terrorism operation , and is always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies . &quot;
the republican representative of california said : &quot; the actions of central command &apos;s behaviour is difficult to accept. one it is our fighters who suffer from war , and the other side is the wrong analysis of senior policymakers . &quot;
the leadership issues of the central command has extended to the highest level of the institution .
the report detailed the long-standing issue of the central command of 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing the united states training in iraqi troops .
although there is no evidence of certainty , senior administration officials in the obama administration have ordered changes in these reports , but according to reports , these analysts feel that they are under pressure from central command leaders to make more optimistic comments about the threat posed by to the central islamic state ( isis ) .
&quot; in the first half of 2015 , many central headquarters press releases , statements and congressional testimony were much more positive than they were , &quot; the report said .
for example , a central command official publicly stated that a major military operation was possible to recapture mosul in april or may 2015 .
mosul , iraq &apos;s second-largest city , mosul , is still under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; republican representative mike pompo said in a statement after months of investigation , &quot; the results are very clear , &quot; republican republican representative mike penapio said in a statement .
from mid-2014 to mid-2015 , most senior united states central command intelligence officers manipulated the headquarters of the headquarters intelligence products and concealed the threat of isis .
the republican party set up a dedicated task force after learning from analysts that information about isis was being manipulated the manipulation of the islamic state was being manipulated .
as the survey continues , more discoveries will be made following the report released thursday .
the department of defence attorney general of the ministry of defence also conducted a long-term investigation into the central command .
members of the house intelligence committee released its findings on thursday , consistent with some of the findings of the republican task force task force .
&quot; between 2014 and 2015 , the central command &apos;s assessment of the intelligence assessment of isis and iraqi peacekeeping forces created an overly narrow process , &quot; the democratic leader of the commission said in a statement .
mr. xie said that the process &quot; interfered with the release of intelligence &quot; , lowered analysts &apos; morale and &quot; could not accept different opinions . &quot;
but mr. xie and the democrats also say they have found no evidence that the white house was trying to pressure analysts at central command to put pressure on the central headquarters , so that their conclusions were &quot; preset or political narrative . &quot;
the beast daily reported the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on tuesday .
last august , the new york times reported that after receiving a complaint from the central headquarters central command analysts , the pentagon &apos;s attorney-general began to investigate .
pentagon spokesman patrick evans said in a statement that the ministry of defense did not comment on the congressional report until the attorney general &apos;s investigation was over .
but he said : &quot; experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data , and intelligence agencies and the defense department encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes . &quot;
the impact of the investigation has exceeded the question of whether the united states-led bombing operations in iraq and syria have been carried out ( increasingly by defence officials ) .
but last year , they raised questions about how much the extent to which president obama could trust in the military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis-stricken areas .
the criticism of islamic state is reminiscent of controversy over a decade ago , when the central command intelligence analyst , gregory hooker , wrote a research article stating that pointed out that the government of george w. bush , despite the opposition of numerous analysts , insisted on sending small-scale troops to iraq and little consideration for the 2003 invasion .
mr. hooker played a key role in the anti-islamic intelligence campaign .
last year , officials indicated that mr. hooker &apos;s team had concluded that the air strikes against the islamic state oil refinery had not significantly reduced the economic income of terrorist organizations , since the terrorist organization had built a temporary oil refinery that continued to sell oil on the black market , contrary to the declared statements .
according to time &apos;s september report , the central command did not disclose the findings .
the central command commander , lloyd austin iii , was criticized last year after several lawyers reviewed the senate testimony regarding an overoptimistic assessment of the war .
general austin , who retired in april and is currently being replaced by joseph venter at central command in his central command post .

bam grew up in broubert , pennsylvania , where he took a up hockey sticks for the first time at age 3 ( her twin sister in drake ) and joined the national team at the age of 16 and became the youngest member of the national team .
unable to get into the final list , she missed the 2008 olympic games .
in 2012 , she and her teammates were not trusted .
the following year , craig palmer was a manager , and everything began to change .
&quot; this is a cultural , mental and substantive change , &quot; mr barm said .

cold acid during the great depression
in march 1933 , franklin delano roosevelt , newly elected president , sat in the presidential office enjoying lunch .
as a gourmet , president roosevelt liked the food of fifth avenue delicacies , such as foie liver sauce and water fish in maryland .
on the day his menu was simple : tomato paste devil eggs , mashed potatoes , and dried fruit pudding .
&quot; this is to share the joys and sorrows of the people who are suffering , &quot; says jane ziegman said : .
her husband , andrew , added : &quot; this also reflects the way americans eat . &quot;
the couple , who live in the brooklyn highlands , are food historians .
mr. cohen &apos;s last book , &quot; homespotch , &quot; is about american food , while ms. zimmerman &apos;s book , &quot; the 97 garden , &quot; tells stories about the lives of the ghetto story of the slum tenants .
the new book , which they co-authored , will be published on tuesday by harper house , which describes american food history during the great depression .
they met a journalist in the sandwich shop at eisenberg , where the simple lunch counter at the iron zone had been open since the 1929 economic boom .
ms. kibaki , 54 , ordered a slice of cream cheese with a crushed olive sandwich , while mr. cox , 57 , ordered turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetables .
the reporter ordered a baking roll , which the couple thought the dishes were suitable for discussing diet during the great depression .
&quot; the bread was very popular at the time , &quot; ms. zimmerman said .
there was peanut bread , liver bread and soy bread .
they all use are made of a raw material and one that can be poured on the raw material .
imagine that your dinner is peanuts .
mr. coe played an odd face played a funny part .
&quot; they &apos;re definitely like lead in your stomach , &quot; he said .
in the years before the great depression , americans had a buffet , especially in the suburbs .
a group of women cook for male farm workers , and breakfast , lunch and dinner have a new pie .
in world war i , it was the americans who gave food to the hungry europeans in the big meal recorded how the country suddenly became a land of affluence . &quot;
mr. koch explained why he and his wife were writing the book : &quot; the food has become the main topic of unhappiness among americans . &quot;
another unpleasant topic is the new food : &quot; food for fans , &quot; such as bread and stew , as the main course , because chefs can use butter in sauces to cover and stews are the &quot; best leftovers , &quot; ms. zimmerman says .
fresh fruit is replaced by cheap fruit .
the meat that has been leading the way for many years has become a rare luxury .
a strange potpodge of calories is only a matter of the odd hodgepodge takes only calories , and the first thing people think about is nutrition compared with taste and even basic cooking .
in the study of the book , including a variety of recipes , ms. zimmerman produced a grilled onions stuffed with peanuts .
&quot; this is not common at dinner tables , &quot; mr coe said .
&quot; it &apos;s too strange , &quot; said ms. zimmerman .
peanut oil is no match for grilled onions .
this is the characteristic of many family economic meals .
family economists influence the country &apos;s eating habits , such as louis stanley , the head chef who served as the chef of the federal family economics bureau from 1923 to 1943 .
they publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines to encourage women to &quot; economize &quot; and be brave enough to turn to bad food like carrots and carrots to food .
&quot; a hearty meal &quot; is a wonderful &quot; historical delicacy &quot; . &quot;
what is particularly interesting is particularly worth playing is the government &apos;s response to the hungry people , such as herbert hoover , the president &apos;s citizen , who i can &apos;t handle the attitude .
although he publicly praised the simple suburban iowa farmhouse , his diet was like a millionaire .
&quot; he likes to eat european western food , such as fish with cucumber sauce , &quot; he said .
he was wearing an evening dress and eating in a gilded restaurant .
he was clearly out of the people .
if not his wife eleanor encouraged him to set an example on his diet , president roosevelt might have made the same mistake if he had .
as the book says , the housekeeper hired by ms. roosevelt had no taste for taste , and the white house food was not only the worst food in washington , but the worst food . &quot;
when the united states returns to formal , many of the cooking styles of the great depression are abandoned .
ms. zimmerman says what is left is our focus on calories and nutrition and the use of science applied to cooking .
the couple said they learned about the eating habits of ms. zimmerman &apos;s mother &apos;s diet , such as how she didn &apos;t throw away did not discard food .
&quot; she is very afraid to waste food , &quot; mr. coe said .
&quot; she actually makes many people sick , &quot; she recalls .
for example , there was a &quot; cream puff &quot; event .
after removing the plates , she and mr. cox took out a dessert they had prepared at home : this is the fruit pudding that president roosevelt had eaten in lunch .
&quot; this is called the cream dried fruit , &quot; said ms. zimmerman , adding that a new name for a common dish is a &quot; trick trick . &quot;
this dessert contains no butter , only dried fruit , a bit of flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone is reluctant to get the spoon into the thick , sticky brown paste .
unexpectedly , the dessert tastes good .
mr. koch ate the second spoon and the third spoon .
he thought it was an acceptable dessert , and told his wife : &quot; it would be better to add a little bit of walnut . &quot;
unfortunately , the latest opec &apos;s latest monthly report shows that production in july has continued to increase and saudi production has hit a new record .
the report does not ban the market &apos;s credibility with opec &apos;s credibility , and the road to oil recovery is still fraught with thorns .
on monday , opec chairman and qatar energy minister saada saada said opec would hold informal meetings during the international energy forum on september 26 - 28 .
the monthly output of opec , including gabon , rose 4.6 million barrels in july to 3311 million b / d , according to a monthly report released wednesday by opec .
opec also said in a monthly report that the price of crude oil has prompted refiners around the world to produce more refined oil products , adding to the extent of oversupply .
as a result of the news , coupled with the united states increase in crude oil production expected and crude oil inventories unexpectedly increased , international oil prices fell for two consecutive days .
light sweet futures traded on new york mercantile exchange fell by 2.48 per cent to the close of wednesday , while london &apos;s brent crude oil in crude oil futures , which delivered in october , fell 2.07 per cent .
according to reuters , the proposed oil-producing meeting is unlikely to tighten supply significantly , and data released by the us energy information agency also weigh on u.s. energy information agency also depress sentiment .
iranian crude oil production is up to 385 million barrels a day , the highest level since 2008 , fars , iran &apos;s official news agency , quoted iran &apos;s minister of oil as saying wednesday .
at the beginning of the meeting emerged , russia &apos;s energy minister , novak novak , said there was no need for a new round of frozen talks under the current oil price .
the last meeting of the oil-producing countries was in april , and opec members failed to agree on any measures .
the markets and the media are likely to overreact to the opec meeting , &apos; says emma richards , an oil and gas analyst at bmiresearch .
hagga wolf , head of commodities strategy at royal bank of canada , said the cartel would change market sentiment by releasing them .
it is like the smoke and mirrors of a person &apos;s eyes ( deliberately misleading ) .
mr weinen weinberg , head of commodity research at commerzbank , said it was believed that opec was low in trying to stabilize the market by september .
this is likely to further undermine the market &apos;s confidence in opec , after all , which has been on the run ever since a &quot; wolf . &quot;

carl skinner , a scottish cyclist , returned to fame after winning a bicycle gold medal
scottish cyclist carl skinner last night was able to defend the olympic gold medal in the men &apos;s group race olympic title after the london 2012 london games .
the 23-year-old glasgow cyclist , who replaced his scottish compatriot , sir chris hoey , who became the backbone of the team. even the legendary cyclist was proud of him when young skinner defeated the popular new zealand team .
four years ago , the british team made an astonishing announcement , and hoyi won fifth out of the six olympic gold medals in the .
the british team had only finished sixth in the world cycling championship in london &apos;s world cycle championships in march , and he had since retired .
during the beijing olympics to the olympics in london , the problem with british teams during was to replace the &quot; first round expert &quot; jamie staff .
the team did this only when cynthia appeared .
kee &apos;s retirement also left a gap , and chien eima and matt cranton wanted to fill the void .
after seeing skinner &apos;s potential , the british men &apos;s team insisted that he be included in the national team , and skinner will ultimately be worthy of his faith .
skinner &apos;s partner , who won a gold medal with hoi four years ago and kenny dalglish , has set the record for the olympic games in the qualifying match , but that was surpassed by the new zealand team in the first round .
the three british cyclists finally beat their opponents and won the gold medal .
although essien is slightly behind , but kenny is leading the team , and skinner has retained this lead to the end .
the change in strategy is the key to this reversal , and hindley has chosen a bigger flywheel , so it is slower , and this allows kenny , especially skinner , to keep pace .
hoi watched the game as a bbc commentator . skinner , kenny and hindley saw him on the podium .
&quot; i &apos;m flattered , &quot; said the 23-year-old glasgow cyclist skinner .
i just do my best to make myself famous .
we set the olympic record in the final and beat the world champion .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
nothing is better than this victory .
after winning the gold medal with kenny and hoy at the 2012 olympics in london games , essien admitted to intentionally falling on the track with a bad start .
he later withdrew the comment , and the british team was unable to appeal .
this victory has no such thing as this .
&quot; it &apos;s like in london , where the british flag is on the platform , &quot; he said .
we just joined the team three months ago .
we &apos;ve lost many world champions , so it &apos;s amazing to be able to defend the olympic champion .
this was just a game and a gold medal for the seven british teams , which competed for 10 golds in the beijing olympics and the olympic games in london games in london .
if this symbolizes the progress we have made in the past five months , we will continue to succeed in the bicycle museum in the next five days .
according to the state of kenny dalglish &apos;s state , he was not able to reproduce the feat of winning three gold medals at a single olympics .
if that was the case , he was 12 years younger than hoyi and was also born on march 23 ( which seems to be the holy day of the british sport , when steve redgrave , mo fargrave and roger bannister and was born on the day ) , who will have six gold medals .
the results were flat with hoi .
kenny will be playing for a three-day race today .
&quot; i &apos;m going to focus on this game for a while , &quot; said bolton , 28-year-old .
the team is always the best .
you can win the game with your teammates .
to be frank , a man is a little lonely .
&quot; if he could win another two gold medals , then he would be awarded a knighthood , &quot; he said .
it was the only event that had produced a medal that day , but the british team received other good news .
sir bradley witkins , ed clancy , steven burke and owen tourl achieved the fastest possible results race to four four-kilometre groups in pursuit of the .
their results were 351.943 .
the world record for gold medal winners in the 2012 london olympics was 351.659 .
the first round and the final ( at 10 : 42 pm ) today will be held on the second day of the race , and wilkins will undoubtedly be the focus of the limelight .
yesterday he had an argument with the match officials before the qualifying match , when the match officials asked him to measure his height .
in the women &apos;s team , which will end tomorrow , laura trotte , joanna rosenthal , joanna rotherer suntech , eleanor barker and kate archibald from milcover set in a new world record of 413.260 .
the british team relied on a strong venue for their own team in the middle of the olympic games to gain several medals in the middle of the olympic games .
after displaying its absolute dominance at the beijing and london olympics , british team made a bit of a disappointment when it came in the course of their journey to rio .
a number of twists took place during the period , including the resignation of sean sutton , technical director of april , and the retirement of legendary legends such as khoei and victoria pendleton .
but the first game of the bicycle pavilion is enough to prove that the british team will be on the top of its peak .

the head of the national development and reform commission &apos;s department of industry and industry , the head of the national development reform council , said today that overcapacity is a global problem .
china &apos;s capacity utilization rate in recent years is higher than the global average , and higher than in countries and regions such as the us and europe .
our country has taken resolute and effective measures to defuse excess capacity , and the results are gradually emerging .
the head of the central committee of the communist party of china ( cpc ) paid attention to the global problem of excess steel production capacity , .
departments and regions are active in implementing the state council &apos;s deployment and working seriously , reducing the amount of rough steel production capacity by about 45 million tons this year .
from our national conditions , we do not encourage steel exports , but also take a series of practical measures to control steel exports .
the leader stressed that the international trade in steel products is essentially the market behavior , which originates from the demand of importing countries and the consumer comprehensive consideration of the products .
the implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the development problems of the global steel industry , but it will only further impact the international trade order .
when it comes to debt , the leader stressed that the solution to the debt problem is the important issues in the process of excess capacity of that needs to be properly addressed .
due to the large scale of the assets of steel and steel enterprises , the broad range , the debt relations of some enterprises , if improper disposal , there can be a regional risk .
according to the director , in recent years , as the economic downward pressure increased , the gradual decline in social aggregate demand gradually weakened , some industry capacity utilization rate decline , enterprise production business is difficult .
some companies are not adapting to market environment change , production operations are unsustainable or even close to collapse , but are constrained by institutional mechanisms and , there are more barriers to exit and become &quot; botnets . &quot;
the existence of such enterprises distorts market signals , reduces the efficiency of factor resources and increases the cost of social management and prevents the establishment of a fair market environment .
the main cause of losses is the same as the dilemma facing the global steel industry &apos;s woes - weak demand and low capacity utilization .
our country mainly adopts market system , economic means and the rule of law , the government is mainly to do the bottom and social stability work , to ensure fair and fair market order .
the leader stressed that the next step would be to remain steadfast to seize the capacity to work and ensure that the target task of $ 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel capacity will be resolved for five years .

the future of the portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty over the cancellation of power supply contracts
the company &apos;s electric power companies supplying factories to the factory disclosed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract , all the supply contracts were invalidated , and the victoria &apos;s portland smelter portland smelter in victoria and hundreds of workers at the factory were currently facing uncertain future .
the move took place after the victorian government decided not to continue the payment of subsidized factory operations .
the two-year fixed subsidy for 20 years will end in november .
two thousand workers at the portland factory in portland may face unemployment .
once the factory is closed , there may be as many as 2,000 direct or indirect unemployed .
and because the plant &apos;s electricity accounts for about 10 % of victoria &apos;s total electricity output , it may have a knock-on effect .
in 2014 , alcoa of the united states closed the hansel smelter , which led to the closure of the united states power plant in anger island last year .
the portland smelter in portland is losing money and is facing the risk of shutting down .
the move was made after a forecast for the plant in the next few years , initially because of a stronger dollar , and recently because of the price of factory products .
agl provides electricity for the large aluminium smelter through the old eyege power plant , which predicts that three other factory owners will end its agreement .
the largest shareholder in the factory is a joint venture between a us aluminium company and alumina , while china &apos;s citic group and japan &apos;s red soft corporation have small stakes .
&quot; agl expects the portland plant to continue to operate , meaning that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand , &quot; said the joint venture .
agl said the contracts were &quot; hedging contracts &quot; that should have come into effect since november 2016 .
the end of the contract is 12 months , and they will be terminated in 2017 .
&quot; the company is still predicting that the contracts will continue to generate revenue in the fiscal year 2017 , &quot; the company said .
any revenue implications for agl from the 2018 fiscal year have now been viewed by the futures market as a bullish prospect for wholesale electricity prices .
the company has written down $ 187 million in the value of the contract , says agl . &quot;
alcoa said the decision to terminate these contracts &quot; would not affect the ability of alcoa to operate the smelter or to guarantee its power supply for the smelter . &quot;
the united states company said it had signed a 20-year contract with old yang in 2010 , which would have come into effect in november , but it did not explain why it withdrew from the contract .
analysts are cautious about whether the portland smelter in victoria and the tommaso plant near newcastle , will be shut down because of a bad economic situation .
in response to comments published earlier this week by analysts , an agl executive director , stephen krickson , said portland &apos;s electricity use reached about 600 megawatts a year and the tomongo plant reached about 900 megawatts .
if the two factories are closed , the demand for electricity markets would be significantly reduced if .
&quot; it &apos;s not good news for us as a power company , &quot; he said .
the community law center excludes 160,000 people a year
more than 160,000 of the people who are most vulnerable each year are rejected by the community legal centre , which has been stretched out of funds and now facing further funding cuts .
in queensland , three out of every five people are denied access to free legal advice and agency services , most of them elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who have no resources to fight injustice .
the lack of funds for community legal services has already exceeded the limit and is now facing further funding cuts .
the federal government &apos;s funding for these centres will be reduced by 30 % since next june , federal .
james farrell , head of the queensland community legal center , says thousands of people are rejected every year according to the latest national association of community legal centres .
mr. farrell said that the situation would only get worse if the federal government does not change its existing decisions .
&quot; the community legal centre in queensland is chronically underfunded , which means thousands of people will not be able to access the essential services they need , &quot; he said .
people who need to stay away from violence , those who are unable to pay the huge debt they are unable to pay , face broken families , crushed workers , all face legal problems , and the report shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the federal government will further cut its funding by 30 per cent since june 2017 , which means that thousands of vulnerable people in queensland will be forced to be forced into complex legal issues without help .
we call on the minister of justice and the queensland congressman george bladis to immediately withdraw the decision to cut back the funds so that people can get the help they need in the face of when faced with legal problems .
last year , the state government promised to raise legal aid funds to the national average .
it is time to focus on the needs of the community &apos;s legal centre and its corresponding communities , and the whitehall government must also be involved in this important work .

according to the results of two other similar cases in the past five years , the drivers will not be liable .
according to the paper , both cases were caused by people walking into the fact that they had been on the highway late in the night. the final verdict was that drivers could not expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight .
last year , a police officer was charged with negligence the death of a person who was accused of having died in august 2014 , when she struck a man and died on an a1 highway near parena , and killed him .
the court heard that the 22-year-old victim had passed the road after drinking .
the judge said after the investigation that the policewoman &apos;s driving was perfectly legal and that the man appeared on the road &quot; completely unexpected and unpredictable , &quot; and the policewoman telephoned first aid later called the emergency call .
any information that could provide information on the accident in the vicinity of thursday &apos;s moon day should be called 021 644 444 or 021 6444 44 , or 021 644 44 44 to the police .
nasa climate model : venus was once suitable for human habitation
according to the new climate model of nasa , venus was once suitable for human habitation .
scientists at nasa &apos;s goddard institute for space research have developed a model for exploring venus &apos; past , using tools and algorithms that are similar to those used by climate scientists .
the model is used to determine whether venus , which has a high temperature , water without water and the atmosphere full of carbon dioxide , ever had a similar to the earth &apos;s environment .
previously , scientists thought venus had a slower rotation because its atmosphere was thicker .
but the latest simulations suggest that venus may once have a thin , earth-like atmosphere that rotates as slowly as it did .
the model also shows the early terrain of venus .
the dry area of venus may be more than the earth , but there used to be enough water and geography to nourish life and prevent rapid evaporation .
in the early days , the sun shone 30 % brighter on venus than the earth .
&quot; in the model simulation of the goddard space institute , venus slowly spins to the side of the day for nearly two months , &quot; the goddard institute for space research space research scientist said at a news conference .
this makes the surface warmer and produces rainwater that can form thick clouds , and thick clouds like an umbrella block most of the sun &apos;s heat .
as a result of the simulation is that venus &apos; average climate temperature is actually a few degrees lower than the current earth .
the simulated venus evolution of the model was similar to that of previous planetary scientists .
although there may have been life on venus , in hundreds of billions of years , venus is exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet light for .
the ocean &apos;s oceans on the planet evaporate , and water vapor is burned out by ultraviolet rays .
with the escape of hydrogen escapes , it leaves only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse gas effect that forms the venus we know today .
the researchers published the simulations of the new venus climate model in the journal geophysical research letters .
patrick roy resigned as an avalanche manager
patrick roy , who resigned as head coach and vice president of the colorado avalanche ice hockey team and vice president on thursday , said he had no say in the team &apos;s decision-making .
joe sachs , vice president of executive vice president for colorado executive vice president , confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for the new manager .
&quot; in the last three years , i have performed the duties of the colorado avalanche coach and vice-president , &quot; roy said in a statement .
i thought seriously about how to improve this team and make it a better throughout the summer , making it more powerful .
for this , the goal of the manager and vice president must be consistent with the club &apos;s goals .
he also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team &apos;s .
but these conditions are not yet to be met .
he hired roy on may 23 , 2013 , thanking roy for his contribution to the team .
&quot; patrick told me about his decision today , &quot; he said .
we thank him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will be successful in the future .
roy , who was nominated for the first season of the avalanche in 2013-14 , was named the best coach of the jack adams league .
he helped the club get 112 points , the first in the middle , but colorado was eliminated by minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost over the last two years in the playoffs .
in the 2015-16 season , the team achieved 39 wins from 39 to 4-4-4 , eventually losing the second qualification for the western union division by 5 points .
as the goalie of the hall of fame , roy won four stanley cup , two for the montreal canadians and an avalanche .
the north sea oilfield workers stop on strike and continue to negotiate
the chief negotiator said the workers at the north sea oil field had stopped a pay strike and the parties in the dispute began a new round of talks .
there has been a number of strikes on the north sea oil platform run by royal dutch shell , against wood group , the north sea oil field .
according to a joint statement , wood group and unite and rmt can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution of the current dispute .
we will start a multi-day meeting in the coming weeks to review these issues , starting early next week .
unions say their recent actions are to protest the highest possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent , the first time the unions have taken the initiative for 25 years .
wood group has cut its compensation for north sea contractors by about 9 % this year because of market pressure .
before the pay cut , the company reduced its compensation for offshore contractors by 10 per cent in 2014 .
the company said another cut in pay would help companies survive the market slump .
shell has laid off thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas facilities in 10 countries because companies need to streamline their operations after a merger with british gas companies .
energy companies are facing pressure from falling crude oil prices and the british decision to take off europe in june .
dave anderson , a member of the scottish parliament , met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of the north sea generation .
he said the north sea was crucial for regional economies .
&quot; in the north sea and across the country , we need a economy that serves the majority of people , &quot; dave said in a statement .
in 2016 , spending on new north sea projects is projected to be less than $ 1.4 billion , compared with an average of about $ 7 billion over the past five years has reached .
kepler measured the rotation speed of stars of the pleiades star cluster
the latest mission of the kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete rotation of the stars of the pleiades star cluster .
new data are helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster have different rotation speeds and links to planets .
&quot; we want to know more about the relationship between the mass , age , and even the history of the solar system by comparing our results with other clusters , &quot; researchers at the ucla center for infrared treatment california institute of technology in pasadena , said at a news conference .
the pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from the earth .
many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are still in adulthood .
they reach the highest speed of rotation in their lifetime .
at the height of the rotation , these mature stars emit large amounts of stellar wind .
when these stellar winds pass through the star &apos;s magnetic field , they produce a brake on stars .
as the age of the star increases , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
kepler tracks the rotation speed of stars by tracking the observable stars , like sunspots ) .
the latest speed data sets indicate that stars with larger mass spin slower than smaller stars .
raoul compared the stars to dancers , and larger dancers spun slower than smaller dancers .
&quot; in a ballet performance in the pleiades star cluster , we find that stars that rotate slower tend to have larger mass , and stars that rotate the fastest are often the lightest stars , &quot; he said .
as a result of the proximity of the pleiades star cluster , it is possible to serve as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparison of the mass of the and the rotation speed of stars .
&quot; the pleiades cluster has laid the foundation for a two-directional rotating theory model for young and elderly stars , &quot; he said .
we still have a lot to learn about how stars , when and why they slow down and &quot; pack up their own dancing shoes . &quot;
he and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the speed of the pleiades star cluster , which will soon be published in the journal astronomy three new papers , which will soon be published in the journal of astronomy , which will soon be published in the journal of astronomy .
the waters at the bottom of south lake , which is more than 10 meters above the bottom of the south lake , are likely to be dangerous , said zheng jianjun , the head of the lake park .
&quot; although the south lake rescue team is very professional , but still hope that the vast majority of boating tourists can put on a life jacket , do not do illegal action on the lake , safe play , &quot; said zheng jianjun .
the surrounding village is blessed with the marine environment , sitting in the natural ecological and humane ecology of two major recreational resources .
&quot; but the individual owner who bought the district parking space , afraid that this will affect their own parking price , but also suspect that others have a private mind , so it has been sabotage , leading to the renovation of the parking space . &quot;
there is still a lot of confusion about when sweet potatoes will be introduced into the issue .
in the current mainstream view , the introduction of sweet potato has three main routes .
the biggest and most widespread of the three lines introduced by sweet potatoes is the introduction of the philippines by the philippines .
the office of social group in beijing community community management office will be conducting a special inspection on the use of uniform receipts for social group membership .
the check is divided into unit self-inspection and focus on two .
according to the organised by social groups relevant director of the municipal association said that the scope of the inspection includes social groups operating in the city community in the year 2013-2015 with a uniform receipt for social groups .
&quot; the success or failure of the olympics is defined by the people who share stories in social media , &quot; the rio organizing committee said in its olympic communications strategy in 2002 .
according to the report of the games , the media in the communication mode , product form , language style , news perspective , many aspects of the past has done a great change .
the international olympic committee and the world &apos;s media players seem to have met the challenge .
on the 11th of august , everbright securities hshares went on sale for the last day. there were that it was flat on the first two days of the ipo , which will be listed first two days .
according to a domestic brokerage analyst , the orient securities is not good at the base of the hong kong , its capital management is the east bank , china securities , citic securities and other banking securities firms , appeared to be inadequate .
experts point out that this year as the stock market returns flat , many brokerage performance has experienced a decline , but after the company &apos;s listing is more likely to see the company &apos;s own business development , not to generalize .
in the wake of the new deal , suzhou will be the first second-line city to restart the restrictions .
the introduction or impending introduction of the market is more than suzhou , the second-tier cities , including hefei and nanjing , nanjing and nanjing .
previously , hefei has been the first to launch a limited lending policy , which will refuse to offer mortgage services in hefei , where there are two apartments in the name of two apartments and an unpaid home home loan .
