primary doctor strike : calls for new labour action
the junior doctor &apos;s representative called on the coalition to approve new labour actions for new contract disputes .
the british medical association &apos;s junior doctors committee will require all its members to support more labour action since early september .
the junior doctors committee said the ministers had not resolved their concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted in july to boycott the contract deal with the british medical association .
58 % of the members participating in the vote objected to the contract transaction .
mccourt , chairman of the junior doctors committee , said in a letter to members in late thursday that the government had &quot; always remained silent &quot; on issues that led to a boycott of the contract .
&quot; in view of this , the executive committee of the junior medical council has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and to call for formal consultations on all concerns , &quot; she said .
in response to the government &apos;s reticence , the executive committee of the junior doctors committee today formally requested the council of the british medical association to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan for the commencement of the upgrading of labour operations from early september .
the dispute has led primary doctors to participate in six strikes this year , including the first comprehensive strike in the history of the british national health service .
dr. johann malawana , a junior physician leader at the british medical association , resigned after the british medical association &apos;s proposed contract agreement was rejected by a vote .
at a meeting of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students before the polls , he told members of the british medical association that the deal was good and should be accepted .
after the vote , the health minister , jeremy hunt , said the contract would be enforced among health care workers in england .
russia and turkey : &quot; incompatible alliances &quot; ?
a gesture to end a crisis .
russian and turkish leaders met in tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to eight months of fighting and economic sanctions .
however , when vladimir putin greeted the turkish president in a magnificent hall in the palace of st. petersburg , i had a strong feeling that the settlement was what ankara would most like to see .
yes , the two sides did shake hands .
however , even as mr putin &apos;s usual standard of restraint , putin is only a shallow smile , almost no enthusiasm .
according to reports , recep five times mentioned &quot; good friend &quot; putin .
i can &apos;t remember .
at the same time , he promised that relations with russia would return to pre-crisis levels , even to a higher level .
the next day , a newspaper here wrote that mr erdogan acted as if nothing had happened .
but i think his enthusiasm hints at something opposite .
however , mr putin &apos;s persistent indifference suggests that he has not forgotten anything .
in fact , the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis : turkey shot down a russian fighter plane on the syrian border .
moscow reacted violently .
mr putin lashed out at the incident , accusing ankara of plotting against moscow behind the scenes .
attacks from so-called friends are more difficult to accept .
it is difficult , or impossible , to re-establish true trust .
russian public opinion has also been reversed since november .
for months , the government-controlled media have made a shocking and all-out attack on ankara .
suddenly , the turks seemed to be responsible for everything .
among the most serious are accusations from senior officials : mr erdogan &apos;s family profited from the illegal oil deals in the so-called islamic state-controlled syrian region .
he has flatly denied such a statement .
however , the news from fort petersburg shows that it is time to look ahead .
after all , the meeting was premised on mr. putin &apos;s apology from turkish president recep tayyip erdogan .
russia can declare victory .
for ankara , the benefits of a truce are obvious .
first , mr erdogan narrowly missed his ouster after the coup failed last month , so he needs the support of all his friends .
the ongoing terrorist attacks have obviously hit him hard .
there are also economic motives .
russia has been hit hard by sanctions against turkey , in particular by banning charter services that can send millions of of russian tourists to the turkish coast every year .
the figure has fallen by nearly 90 % .
as the flight resumes , russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved .
they will usher in the mediterranean tourist season at the quarter .
state television even predicted this week that the price of fruits and vegetables would fall once turkey &apos;s agricultural imports were reopened .
&quot; the tourists are gone and the tomatoes are back , &quot; said a report by vedemosti , a moscow newspaper .
for moscow , the visit also has added political value .
ankara was outraged by the west &apos;s faint reaction to takeover intentions .
in addition , ankara is keen to take advantage of the political chill and weaken turkey &apos;s relations with the west in a long period of frustration over the slow progress of joining the eu negotiations and mr putin &apos;s involvement .
with the election of the elected authorities after the failure of the coup , russia &apos;s leaders will be given ankara &apos;s bonus points .
note that this is a gift to moscow , which has been deeply rooted in the fear of regime change .
thus , the meeting in this magnificent seaside palace has made russia and turkey an ally of two countries rejected and abused by the west , an analyst who described it as &quot; incompatible alliances &quot; .
however , despite public reconciliation , there are still significant differences between the two sides .
syria is one of the key factors . moscow recently played the role of peacemaker in syria , while russia and turkey support the opposing factions .
predictably , after nearly three hours of preliminary talks , the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not yet talked about the topic .
the turkish president deliberately sidestepped the issue of disagreement between the two sides , while putin stressed it .
the two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to disagree on syria .
the resumption of dialogue between the two leaders is certainly a good thing , with the possibility of months of open hostility and a major catastrophe caused by the shooting down of russian warplanes by turkey , a member of the north atlantic treaty organization .
royal bank of scotland will no longer serve customers outside scotland
according to rbs &apos;s chief executive , the bank will be reduced to a logistics unit .
royal bank of scotland will no longer serve customers outside scotland .
ross mckyon told the bbc scottish division that the royal bank of scotland brand was committed to its global ambitions .
but eight years ago , the brink of collapse , had to accept the rescue from then on to abandon the pursuit .
during that time , brand strategists used srbs to protect other consumer financial brands .
the group has spent £ millions of to sponsor international sporting events , including the rugby six-nation tournament and wimbledon tennis championship champion andy .
but now , the right thing to do is make more national brands emerge .
rbs will be used for scottish customers but will not revert to the original .
in england and wales , all references outside the headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to the national westminster bank .
the ulster bank brand has been used to ireland , rep. of customers in the autonomous region of northern ireland .
there are other , more prominent , smaller private banking brands , such as guzi bank , adam &amp; co , drummond and holts military bank .
mr. mcewen was interviewed by clients and employees in inverness county .
he told the bbc &apos;s scottish division : &quot; the royal bank of scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employees &apos; hired brands because we have become a bank with many brands in the larger sense now . &quot;
as the bank itself becomes an international brand , rbs has become a global brand .
at present , i would like to say that we are no longer focused on the global , we have turned our eyes to the mainland .
each of the a brands represents a different industry , and our employees serve customers through different brands .
rbs has indicated it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation championships , and has tried to raise the profile of various brands in sporting events .
&quot; it &apos;s time to become a multi-brand bank , because privately we &apos;ve been exploring how to be a better bank to serve our customers , &quot; the chief executive said .
it would be ironic if we aspire to be a big bank with many brands three years ago .
we are now focusing on customer needs and i believe you have noticed these changes .
i think we can restart these brands and the time is right .
daituri with the success of predilection in the newmarket career 3,000 win
newmarket &apos;s two victories helped daituri get a career 3,000 victory , after which he sprayed champagne to celebrate
in friday , professional jockey daituri ( frankie dettori ) made his 3rd , 000 victory in newmarket ( newmarket ) .
he took the gollsden ( john gosden ) &apos; s hand predilection on the road , the two victories in the evening , also to achieve a career 3,000 win .
the 45-year-old italian is the sixth professional jockey who has scored this milestone in the field of the plains .
the first five were : gordon richard ( gordon richards ) , doug ( doug smith ) , berge ( lester piggott ) , weideley ( pat eddery ) and jason ( willie carson ) .
&quot; this is special , &quot; said daituri , a three-year champion jockey who won the ghayyar earlier .
i &apos;m excited because my family is on the scene .
i am pleased with what i have achieved in newmarket because i started here 30 years ago .
this is not a large-scale jockey club , nor is it the royal ascot , which is just an ordinary friday night with 20,000 spectators .
i am gratified and humble .
daituri in the victory after the predilection , causing the audience cheers
in the area of the barrier , two jockeys have made this achievement , respectively the champion jockey richard johnson ( richard johnson ) and now retired 20-term champion mccoy ( anthony mccoy ) jazz , in which sir mccoy has scored more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career .
berge , a nine-year-german champion , won 4,493 victories in his career .
daituri is one of the best jockeys in the contemporary era , so it is not surprising that he has achieved this milestone , not many people have achieved it before .
he is fashionable and robust , but what really makes him stand out in the weighing room is his tactical rationality .
he is a great equestrian ambassador , and over the years his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted a lot of fans for the sport .
a few weeks ago , i told daituri in epsom that if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and a big-game jockey , he should have won 6,000 victories !
seriously , daituri is the best equestrian winner in 30 years in britain .
he was lively , and that was a good thing for the british horse race , but beyond that he was an incredible jockey .
daituri celebrates the milestone with its iconic jump-dismount
for 20 years , daituri has been a typical representative of the british land race field , from jumping lines to jumping off the ground .
his career is like a roller coaster .
he won several championships , including the famous &quot; seven winning streak &quot; in 1996 at the royal love club , but he also suffered a crash and was banned for taking the banned drugs .
three years ago , when he returned to the game after the end of the six-month period , he struggled . but he showed an astonishing character advantage and finally returned to the top , giving blow to those who were skeptical .
he may not be able to do it for a long time-daituri has said before that he wants to be at least 50 years old .
russian president vladimir putin relieves sergei chief of staff
vladimir putin , russia &apos;s president , unexpectedly relieved sergei ( sergei ivanov ) of the presidency of the office of the president .
mr ivanov has been a member of the core group that mr putin has trusted for years .
the 63-year-old ivanov has now been appointed special representative for the environment and transport .
a statement from the kremlin said mr. putin had &quot; announced the release of the office of the chief of the russian president of ivanov , &quot; but gave no reason .
anton vaino ( anton vaino ) , who became deputy to mr. ivanov in 2012 , has been appointed as his successor .
mr. vaino , 44 years old , is a former diplomat .
born in 1972 in tallinn , the capital of estonia , he graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute for international relations ( mgimo ) and worked at the embassy in tokyo .
later , he managed the presidential draft and government employees , the kremlin &apos;s website ( using russian ) said .
after his appointment , he said to mr putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i think the most important task of the government is to support the heads of state in drafting laws and controlling directives .
mr. putin told russian television in friday that mr. ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended mr. vaino to take over .
is that a convincing smile ?
moscow was puzzled by the move .
sergei has long been one of mr putin &apos;s closest aides , working for the soviet security service ( kgb ) , as did mr putin .
as director of the office , he was one of the most influential people in the country .
at a meeting with president putin on state television , both men said the chief executive himself had asked to resign .
although smiling in front of the camera , few people are convinced-especially before the parliamentary elections .
so , is this the result of a defeat in some sort of power struggle ?
it is not yet known .
but the official claim that a man who was once seen as a candidate for the presidency suddenly chose to take charge of the environmental policy of russia has aroused much scepticism .
the kremlin website quotes mr ivanov and mr putin as saying : &quot; yes , at the beginning of 2012 , i asked you to give me this difficult position in a conversation , even a troublesome position , a four-year term . &quot;
&quot; as a result , i have served as director of the president &apos;s office for 4 years and eight months . &quot;
mr. ivanov held the post in december 2011 .
prior to that , he served as deputy prime minister and secretary of defense .
he is a member of the russian security council , as well as former members of the national security service , like mr putin .
mr. ivanov was appointed as his deputy in in the late 1990 of the 20th century when mr. putin served as director of the federal security service ( fsb , formerly the national security agency ) .
after mr putin came to power , he appointed mr. ivanov one of the five most trusted .
it was once thought that mr ivanov might be the president of russia after mr putin &apos;s second term , since the third term is unconstitutional .
but the position is ultimately vested in mr putin &apos;s other close aide , dmitry dmitry .
mr putin served as russia &apos;s prime minister before he was back in office after 3.5 .
mysterious fish discovered banff a garden
a resident of banff discovered that fish had found its own garden and had subsequently sent for help .
kevin bain thinks the 75 fish may be the sand eel that was blown by a tornado in the sea .
mr. bain , who lives about 500 metres from the sea , released a video of the bizarre scene on periscope , hoping someone could explain to him why these two-inch fish were present .
the queensferry bridge is now in fife .
the £ 1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in may 2017
engineers have connected the north bridge of the queensferry bridge ( queensferry crossing ) to the viaduct , which means that it is now in fife .
the closure of the &quot; bridge deck fan &quot; near the three bridgehead of each bridge is nearing completion and the project is headed for a closed bridge .
the bridge starting in fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it uses 10,000 metric tons of steel , 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 diagonal cables .
the £ 1.35 billion bn project is scheduled to be completed in may 2017 .
keith brown , the economics minister , visited the scene today as one of the first people to board the bridge , keith brown .
&quot; this is a historic moment in the construction process of the queensferry bridge , &quot; he said .
we have all witnessed the engineering work on such a grand project , which used more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel in this section of the bridge .
although the bridge is large in size and weight , the closure between the viaduct and the bridge requires meticulous work and very precise assembly .
in general , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is now installed , the last section of the bridge deck concrete bridge today in the rosyth pouring , that is , all the bridge deck is ready .
queensferry bridge construction company project director michael martin said : &quot; no matter which bridge project , the first closure is a major milestone . &quot;
in terms of this remarkable project , the closure shows the frontier of civil engineering technology .
after installing the last section of the pavement and connecting it to the enlarged north bridge pavement , the remainder of the remaining gap on either side or near the land will need to be closed .
the completion of this operation requires the north elevated approach to move south 700 mm .
it was a huge operation and a very sophisticated one .
it is large because the viaduct is 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes and needs to pull out a slope of about 3 % .
it is precise because the engineering team needs to make sure that the deviations are very small , with only a few millimeters on each side .
thankfully , everything went well .
simon biles picks women gymnastics all-around champion
forget about stress .
forget about hype .
simon biles ( simone biles ) is not affected by all this .
the vault was full of vigor .
on the balance beam .
the floor exercises are stunning .
the overall performance is excellent .
now , finally , became the olympic champion .
the 19-year-old american gymnast picked up all-around in thursday and showcased her talent for the world in gymnastics in the olympic arena .
she has a 62.198 overall score far beyond the silver medalist , the &quot; ultimate five &quot; ( final five ) player lesman ( aly raisman ) and bronze medalist mustafina ( aliya mustafina ) .
simon byers , from the united states , performed the balance beam on the women &apos;s personal all-around finals at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , in thursday .
byers to help the united states team in the olympic games women &apos;s gymnastics to achieve four consecutive championships , she personally in the olympic games won five medals , further confirmed that she is this generation , also may be history , the best gymnasts .
when see oneself total score of that moment , byers can &apos;t help shed tears . she finally ended the long journey .
byers is thus among the &quot; athletes of the decades &quot; , like michael phelps , who have promoted their sport to new heights in their respective fields :
byers has been dominating the game for the last three years , a total of 15 world championships were won , including 10 gold medals . she worked hard every day to achieve higher accuracy . &quot; byers is the best gymnast i &apos;ve ever seen , &quot; said mary lou retton , 1984 olympic champion mary lou retton .
there is still one last game in brazil , but it is not so much a contest as byers and other gymnasts , but a contest between herself and the pressure of great expectations .
if byers does not have a full gold medal back at her home in texas springs , everyone will be very disappointed .
simon biles ( left ) and lesman , from the united states , embraced each other in august ( thursday ) at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , for the women &apos;s individual all-around finals with gold and silver medals respectively .
byers won the first gold medal in tuesday , giving the retiring national coach caroli ( martha karolyi ) a surprise farewell gift .
although bairstine says he has no plans for the future in the course of the perennial title , it is not entirely true .
the part of byers &apos;s floor exercise--including her iconic , rolling series , was accompanied by latin music , which she heard in the middle of a street from the rio olympic stadium .
this is no coincidence .
the girl who was adopted by his grandparents during his infancy and was found by the mother of coach amy boerman ( aimee boorman ) during a field trip to the stadium has now grown into a backbone .
since the summer of 2013 , byers has not lost in the all-around game , if want to win , she will definitely win .
mustafina a slight lead after two rotations is just an illusion .
the balance beam and floor exercise two-item defending world champion byers ambush to wait .
her balance beam scored 15.433 and the floor was 15.933 .
while waiting for the final score to come out , lesman gently hugged byers . when byers learned that he had achieved his dream , he immediately left tears .
lesman &apos;s performance was a bit like revenge for four years ago , when she tied third , but lost to mustafina in the run-off .
but this time , the 22-year-old captain , nicknamed &quot; granny &quot; by the americans , is far ahead .
she blew kisses at the end of the floor and declared her return , but the return sometimes seemed questionable .
byers is only 19 years old . from earlier this week , the news spread viral on twitter . in the case of bayer , his life has been given a new meaning .
6-year-old mahaj brown was spared in the philadelphia shootings .
police say a six-year-old boy was shot in philadelphia , a six-year-old child in the city &apos;s second shot this week .
the child &apos;s grandparents confirmed to cbs philadelphia that the child being shot was mahaj brown .
brown &apos;s groin , legs , arms and abdomen have multiple gunshot wounds , they say , but the child is awake on the way to the hospital .
&quot; he &apos;s had a lot of sins and his little body was riddled with bullets , &quot; his grandmother delores melendez told the television .
i can &apos;t believe it .
the boy was in a critical condition at the hospital and had been undergoing several surgeries .
his family told the tv station that children are expected to recover .
he was supposed to start his first grade in a local primary school .
brown is one of four people who were shot in the germantown area .
of the other three people who were shot , two were 29 years old and one 32 years old .
according to cbs philadelphia , one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition and two other victims were in stable condition .
television said the child and the 29-year-old victim was found in the front seat of the car .
the other two were not in the car and the police were investigating whether the gunman was among the injured .
investigators told cbs philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen had exchanged fire .
many of the shells of offensive weapons were found at the scene , which could be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons .
judging from this , this is undoubtedly a continuous war .
there are shells on the sidewalks on both sides of the street .
&quot; therefore , it can be seen that at that time there were many armed men in a state of fierce fighting , &quot; philadelphia police commissioner anthony ginaldi told television .
a number of buildings and vehicles have been damaged in the area .
no arrests have been made , and police are said to be watching surveillance footage .
in tuesday , a six-year-old child ( girl ) was shot in the arm by a stray bullet while playing at the doorstep of the west oak lane community .
she is recovering and the police are still chasing suspects .
why do we need simon , gabrielle and laurie ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m judging this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason .
first of all , since 1984 , i have been to every summer olympics , but the united states has never been such a dominant position .
second , the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts-simon biles ( simone biles ) , gabriel douglas ( gabby douglas ) and lauri hernandez ( lauren laurie hernandez ) , who have been inspiring many colored girls .
the composition of this team has made everyone proud , as it contains the jewish ali lesman ( aly raisman ) and the catholic madison chian ( madison kocian ) .
the team finally looks like the american team .
it also cemented the pinnacle of black and hispanic women in the sport .
the leading female gymnasts have been african-american for the past four years .
last year , simon and gabrielle the first and second place .
that &apos;s too bad .
the last olympic games , gabriel douglas &quot; unexpectedly &quot; to become the olympic champion , which makes the united states cheer .
today , the world can witness three world champion simon biles , douglas and lauri hernandez fantastic performance . they performed the usual gymnastics skills .
in thursday , simon helped the united states to achieve four consecutive championships in women &apos;s individual all-around projects .
her teammate ali lesman the silver medal .
we climbed to the top of the sport , but not in the american gymnastics class .
the way simon , gabrielle and laurie entered the olympic team was the same as ali and madison .
they are the &quot; ultimate five &quot; ( final five ) , because the next olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnasts , this is marta karolyi last one years of coaching .
but the reality is , gymnastics is an expensive sport in which gymnasts are trained mainly in private gymnastics clubs , and their parents need to pay for training , facilities , travel , clothing , competitions and hotel fees ( including the costs of coaches and gymnasts and their families ) , and the list of costs is increasing .
most of the gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the industry .
all of the gymnasts &apos; training is done at these clubs and is a long and expensive expense for gymnasts &apos; families .
byers &apos;s coach amy boerman ( aimee boorman ) and hernandez &apos;s coach maggie haney have been coaching them since the two gymnasts began practicing gymnastics .
we must bring more affordable , more accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls who are affected by simon , gabrielle and lloyd .
20 years ago , i set up my own gymnastics foundation .
in my organization , we offer free , inexpensive gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youths ( mostly black and hispanic americans ) in black neighborhoods , and to develop national and even world champions .
in september , we will expand to detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high-quality gymnastics to those who deserve this learning opportunity and who will benefit from this remarkable olympic campaign .
gymnastics can help to cultivate the strength , flexibility and coordination of the body , but also help to cultivate hard-working spirit , self-discipline and determination .
these can provide lifelong benefits for the health , academic and work success of a of people .
inspired by this team , thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics , which is really great .
participation in sports is significant , especially for girls .
it was an exciting moment .
thanks to simon , ali , laurie , gabrielle and madison for the &quot; girl power &quot; that has been shown in winning the olympic team gold medals , and for inspiring young girls with so many backgrounds to open the path to health , greatness and success .
after dismissing the jeremy proposal , the junior doctors plan to initiate a further strike
the ministers initially wanted to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract from the british medical association ( bma ) officials , but 58 % of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted were against the contract .
in july , mr. hunter revealed plans to enforce the contract , saying that the nhs is currently in a &quot; vacuum zone &quot; and that a slight delay would hurt the interests of employees and patients .
the new contract first mentions changes in the working practices of primary doctors overnight and weekend to improve the care of irregular working hours .
last night , dr. ellen mccourt , chairman of the bma junior physician committee , said in a statement : &quot; junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and do not treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
it &apos;s only eight weeks before the first doctor signs the new contract and we need to make progress .
bma tried to resolve the dispute through negotiations , but everyone was unwilling to participate , and sometimes the government responded with silence .
still , just last month we got a jeremy commitment , saying that his door was open .
&quot; jeremy now needs to take action to eliminate enforcement and address the concerns of junior doctors . &quot;
if he does not , the junior doctors make it clear that they are ready to take further labor action .
the last strike , which occurred at the end of april , resulted in nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointment delays , as nurses and consultants covered the picket line for doctors .
the ministers initially hoped to end the dispute caused by the change by accepting bma &apos;s revised contract .
bma hopes to secure better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract .
daniel mortimer , chief executive of nhs employers , called on junior doctors to stop any further strikes .
mr mortimer said : &quot; the effect of the labour action is minimal , but it will put pressure on the teams and services already devoted to them , causing concern , worry and confusion among patients , nursing staff and their families . &quot;
over the past two months , we have been negotiating with the junior doctors &apos; committee , and have been actively responding to their concerns about the role of guardians and the disclosure of their complaints with the ministry of health and other departments .
employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics-such as deployment , flexibility in training , and other training for those who have been back in their careers , the cost of training , the common understanding of the syllabus , the gender wage differentials in further studies and the medical field , illustrate the importance that employers , the english health education organization ( health education england ) and the ministry of health attach to the agreements reached with bma in november , february and may .
2 pounds of drugs a day can reduce the risk of heart attack .
officials suggest that a drug of 2 pounds a day be extended to more patients and to take longer , and thousands of heart patients will benefit from the drug .
anticoagulant drug ticagrelor ( ticagrelor ) can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease .
the drug , which lasts for 12 months after a heart attack , can reduce the risk of another stroke or heart attack .
the national institute of health and clinical optimization ( nice ) , a regulator of the nhs , advises patients to continue taking four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease .
but now , the nhs regulator , nice , recommends that patients continue to take four years of medication to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease .
in england , about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year , and one-fourth continue to suffer from heart attacks or strokes .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fatty matter in the arterial wall .
if the plaque is broken , it can lead to thrombosis , which in turn hinders blood flow to the heart , leading to heart attack .
if the thrombus moves , it enters the bloodstream , hindering blood flow to the brain and causing a stroke .
patients who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of heart attack .
ticagrelor is made by the british company astrazeneca ( astrazeneca ) , which is marketed in the name of linda ( brilique ) , which reduces the risk of developing the disease by reducing thrombosis .
the nice draft guidelines , released today , recommend that patients take the ticagrelor for 12 months , taking 60mg ticagrelor and two aspirin a day for three years .
professor carole longson , director of the nice health technology assessment center , said : &quot; despite effective two-level preventive treatment , as many as one-fourth patients who have had a history of heart attack relapse or stroke , often with serious consequences . &quot;
fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a of people .
evidence suggests that taking ticagrelor with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence and stroke in patients who experience a heart attack .
we are pleased that the temporary recommendation for ticagrelor will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who benefit .
given the limited information about the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor in three years , especially the risk of bleeding , the draft guidance does not recommend continuing treatment after that period .
computer culture makes &quot; electoral fraud &quot; prevalent in muslim areas
tower hamlets , former mayor of lutfur rahman , was sacked last year for corruption , prompting a government report .
the culture of &quot; political correctness &quot; has led to the blindness of electoral fraud prevalent in muslim communities , as the government &apos;s report , which is destructive , is revealed today .
sir eric pickers , the former cabinet secretary , has accused the police , the election regulator and the city hall of ignoring the evidence of the misuse of the election because of &quot; overly sensitive to ethnicity and religious issues &quot; .
the former minister of community affairs , the current anti-corruption chief , said the practice of intimidation of voters by religious positions was bad and that police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside polling stations to protect frightened voters .
he advises voters to carry identity documents to prove their identity .
at present , voters only need to quote their name and address .
the report even suggests wiping out ink on voters &apos; fingers to prevent people from voting two times .
sir eric said more protection should be given to whistleblowers .
he called for an increase in the media &apos;s access to parliamentary documents and decisions made by non-official committees or working groups .
&quot; it &apos;s not just to prevent electoral fraud , but to protect local governments from widespread corrupt culture and the toxic financial scams that are closely linked to them , &quot; he said .
the report was requested by downing street after the tower hamlets election scandal in eastlondon .
last year , a special election court ruled that there was a series of corruption and illegal acts in the mayor &apos;s office , and should be dismissed .
the court found that mr. rahman was &quot; very ridiculously abusing &quot; the religious sentiments of the muslim community and kept silent about his accusations of racism and islamophobia .
it is said that rahman &quot; declared his vote in the campaign as a religious obligation of the faithful muslims . &quot;
as many as 300 votes are doubtful , and voters may be counterfeited by others .
sir eric says there is evidence that electoral fraud has been found all over the country .
in particular , he warned of the mailing of electoral fraud , where senior members of the muslim community were said to have pressured voters to vote for their designated candidates .
sir eric ( in the photo ) has given a number of suggestions for clearing the voting mechanism , including the identification of the identity card , to prove his identity .
&quot; the evidence suggests that senior members , particularly in the background communities in pakistan and bangladesh , have put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities , especially women and young people , to vote on their own volition , &quot; he said in his report .
&quot; because they are overly sensitive to racial divisions and religious &apos; political correctness &apos; , they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behaviour . &quot;
sir eric proposed 50 proposals to clean up the voting system , including banning political activists from sending ballot papers to prevent &quot; voting gains &quot; .
the report also requires strict checks on registration information to prevent voter rolls from being used for immigration and welfare fraud . theresa ( theresa may ) is also considering the report .
these proposals include requiring electors to show their identity cards before voting .
after the vote , the voter &apos;s fingers were smeared with indelible ink to prevent a two-time vote .
systematic verification of voters &apos; ethnic affiliation to ensure voter eligibility .
limit the validity of the automatic mail poll request to three years .
political activists and activists are barred from handling completed mailings and mailing ballot envelopes .
authorized police to set up a cordon around the polling station .
the amendment of the legal provisions makes it easier to charge the persons concerned with intimidation in accordance with the 1983 people &apos;s representative act ( representation of the people act 1983 ) .
it is illegal to take pictures at a polling station .
it is stipulated that only english ( except wales ) can be used at polling stations .
( a ) strengthen training to ensure that staff members strictly implement the provisions of the &quot; voter-independent vote-room &quot; .
sir eric denounced the metropolitan police ( metropolitan police ) , saying they were &quot; surprised &quot; that they had not filed any criminal charges after the tower hamlets incident .
&quot; there are a lot of corruption and irregularities in mr. rahman and his election officers , and are therefore disqualified from the electoral court , &quot; he said .
he was guilty in many ways , in accordance with the standards of criminal proof .
he also criticized the city hall election registration department as &quot; check box &quot; .
&quot; last year , the court sounded a wake-up call to the tower hamlets verdict , &quot; said sir eric .
our country has a glorious tradition of &quot; the mother of parliament &quot; , but it is a matter of concern and threat to the good reputation of some institutions in the private and furtive conduct of electoral fraud and subsequent repudiation .

jenny davidson ( two children &apos;s mother ) , who was also in the store , said that after trying on her underwear , the mysterious woman &quot; dressed again and went out of the store and bought nothing . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t believe what you &apos;re seeing , &quot; she said .
she was standing in the middle of the store , taking a pair of panties off the shelves , stripping off her tights and panties , and then putting them on .
&quot; she didn &apos;t try to find the hidden place to try it-she just stood there , really cheeky . &quot;
&quot; when she took her panties off again , everyone was stunned . apparently , she was still dissatisfied because she put her panties back on the shelves . &quot;
after that , she tried three like this , and finally found out that she didn &apos;t like it , then dressed again and went out of the shop .

how to protect yourself with the use of gamma in a gun attack
the world is dangerous , but this video on dailymail may give you a sense of security .
we consulted the master rhon mizrachi of new york &apos;s krav maga federation to learn how to deal with gunmen at close range .
whether he is close to you from the front or behind , the video will teach you how to defeat .
mizrachi said that if the shooter approached you from behind , the first thing you had to do was turn around so that you could see the attacker and &quot; clear the line &quot; .
then , hold the gun with your forearm and shoulder and hit the attacker on the face with your elbow .
then with the knee on his groin , when the attacker bent over with pain , he reversed his gun , hit him in the face with the barrel and the backing gun , and kept his weapon on him .
if the gunman comes in from the front , it also uses a similar technique--to keep your body out of the firing line , grab the gun and twist the muzzle so that the shooter doesn &apos;t fire .
at the same time , press the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest and twist the muzzle from his clenched hand and then point the muzzle at him .
sounds complicated ?
check out the video to see what mizrachi is doing .
but remember , if you &apos;re not the master of the gamma , the safest way to get out of a robbery is to hand over the cash .
a family of rogue families destroyed a low-rent house in sortas , cornwall , before being deported .
a family of rogue families who had been evicted for threatening their neighbours had damaged their low-rent housing before leaving , costing 50000 of pounds .
after a long list of complaints , tanya skeldon and her husband , shaun trebilcock , were evicted from a low-rent house in the cornish county of sortas .
after being forcibly removed from the residence , housing association officials were surprised to find that there had been serious damage .
the walls were full of holes , the floors torn , the rubbish strewn all over the floor , the walls smeared with clutter .
after being expelled , the family has been moving and is said to be living in a private house .
donna mcevoy , housing manager at cornwall county housing association , said she feared the house could not be saved .
&quot; it &apos;s a nightmare for people living here , and i don &apos;t think people can live like this , &quot; she said .
there are a lot of things to weigh , because the house is likely to become a bad element in cornwall .
the family is notorious and their names are equally notorious .
the couple had three sons who would live here from time to place . police say the terror of the family includes fighting in the streets with baseball bats , terrorizing nearby residents , drugs , drugs , shouting , arguing and swearing .
in june , the 47-year-old tenant named skeldon received a resolution on anti-social behavior .
in a house that could be demolished , many of the rooms were garbage for a long time .
in this room where the drugs were traded , the floors were lifted
neighbors say they often see them fighting in the streets , and they often call the police
after giving them a 11-week extension , the cornish housing society forced her and her husband to drive away from the house this week .
the neighbors , who finally breathed a sigh of joy , said that life had been a living hell .
a neighbour said , &quot; they don &apos;t care about anyone . &quot;
we &apos;ve lived next door to them for 20 years , and it &apos;s been so bad .
we &apos;ve seen the police countless times .
&quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot;
we got up early because it was so quiet-we weren &apos;t used to it !
it &apos;s very kind of them to leave at last .
fitzpatrick , the community executive manager of the cornish housing society , said the family had failed to cooperate with the local government .
the family lived in the house for 20 years , and the police often visited
rubbish and old toys were tossed over the overgrown side of the low-rent house
he added : &quot; it is regrettable that the tenant has not been held responsible for the conduct of her family and the expulsion is the last thing considered by the cornish housing association . &quot;
this is a very difficult case to deal with , because their behavior is very extreme , and what they do must make the neighbors feel extremely terrified .
i am thankful for the work done by my team and thanks to the devon and cornwall police as well as the community members who are brave enough to provide us with information .
i hope this will bring some comfort to our neighbors and convey the message that we are not tolerant of anti-social behaviour .
mr fitzpatrick says three of their sons lived in the house at different times , but said they were only more than 20 years old .
after they were driven away , one of the bedroom floors was littered with a dirty mattress .
housing association workers will soon be cleaning up piles of rubbish around the house
in 2014 , police raided the house , found more than more than 70 grams of cannabis , and found scales , drug paraphernalia and 1,700 pounds of cash .
after pleading guilty , skeldon was fined for possessing class b drugs and trafficking in drugs .
she claims that the money was used to buy gravestones for the son lee skeldon , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
it is understood that after homeless , tanya and her husband now live in a private house in plymouth .
the walls of the house were painted with graffiti .
police said they would expel tenants who defied tenant rules .
angela crow , of devon and the cornish police department , said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to defy tenant rules .
&quot; the warning is for people who think their actions are not being blamed , and those who have been devastated by this behavior , &quot; she said .
devon and cornwall police will never tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour , and they &apos;ll continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

french court rejects petition to dismantle shops in jungle camps
a courts in france have rejected a petition by the government of calais to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle camp , where thousands of refugees currently reside .
at the court hearings this week , the government argued that the french government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp . people in these stores in the camps sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer haircuts , and sell tea at 50 cents ( 40 pence ) in makeshift restaurants or selling basic meals at several euros .
the office of the district of calais believes these places should be dismantled because they are parallel economies that do not pay taxes , as well as fire and health hazards .
humanitarian groups have indicated to the court that these shops and restaurants are of paramount importance , as the free food provided by state-backed associations and other groups simply cannot meet the needs of the growing refugee population in the camp .
these makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelters and free food for those in need , they say .
a court in lille ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary shops , but said the concerns of the governor of calais were &quot; perfectly understandable &quot; .
jean fran c ois molla said the role of these grocery stores , cafes and restaurants is far more than simply providing food for refugees who &quot; live in extremely dangerous conditions &quot; .
these places , he says , are a calming point of convergence between refugees and volunteers .
one of the threats to demolition was the &quot; jungle book kids &quot; café in the camp , which offered 200 servings of food , english and french lessons each day , as well as advice on asylum for hundreds of of the most vulnerable minors in the refugee camp .
more than more than 170,000 people have signed petitions to protect the café .
closing the café &quot; will be a catastrophe for these children ( many children are only eight years old ) , &quot; wrote a letter to the guardian guardian .
help refugees and leauberge des migrants , the two charitable organizations , predicted in friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps had exceeded 9000 , the highest level since the summer refugee population surged .

prior to january 1 , 2016 , the existing sewage disposal unit of eia has not been levied for a fee .
&quot; the right to receive pollution from the sewage is not equal to the power to illegally discharge pollutants . &quot;
qingdao environmental protection bureau deputy director of the han red yan introduced , if the illegal discharge , exceeding the sewage still should be punished according to the relevant regulations , it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises through the purchase of pollution right way to avoid punishment .
in other words , by means of legal measures to crack down on environmental violations , severely punish the excessive discharge of enterprises , thereby protecting the environment and safeguarding public health .
now enterprises in order to their own interests , improve the enthusiasm of pollution control , cherish the limited emission rights , reduce pollutant emissions .
with the drive of economic benefits , reducing pollutant emissions from the government &apos;s compulsory behavior into the enterprise conscious market behavior , so as to really achieve the protection of the environment , protection of nature , the purpose of safeguarding public health .
the right to discharge is also called &quot; emission right &quot; , which is the right to emit pollutants , that is , the right of the emitter to discharge the pollutant to the environment in accordance with the government &apos;s allotted amount .
in essence , this right is the right of polluters to occupy , use and benefit the environmental capacity resources .
next , under the premise that the total pollutant emissions do not exceed allowable emissions , the internal pollution sources are exchanged with each other by means of currency exchange .
emissions trading since 1968 by american economist dales , the united states in in the 1970 of the 20th century began to apply it to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources .
china since 2007 to carry out pilot , now has zhejiang , jiangsu and other 14 provinces ( regions , municipalities ) in full implementation .
according to the russian ministry of defense , in order to assist the 6 strategic bombers in syria , the &quot; islamic country &quot; targets in the air strikes , several russian warplanes from the syrian state air force base to provide support .
on february 22 this year , the united states and russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the syrian conflict , and the ceasefire has been implemented since 27th of the month .
according to the agreement , the ceasefire does not include a military strike against the terrorist groups identified by the un security council , such as the &quot; islamic state &quot; &quot; support front &quot; .
russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base , and the living conditions of the russian servicemen will be safeguarded accordingly .
he added that those forces would expand to russia without a crackdown on extremist forces .
although russia and the west did not agree on a joint fight against the syrian extremist forces , russia will strengthen its cooperation with syria , iran and iraq in this regard .
in september 2015 , russia began a military strike against the syrian extremist forces at the invitation of syria &apos;s government .
march 15 this year , russia &apos;s main military forces in syria began to withdraw , but the russian side pledged to continue to maintain the tartous airbase and stationed at the naval base .

china &apos;s mars program is coming
the mission of mars exploration in china is to be rounded , landed and inspected at once , and this form has never been in foreign countries .
the goal of our mars reconnaissance launch is to get around , to land , to patrol , this task is very difficult .
because the mars probe will take 26 months to meet a time window , experts are working on a rigorous engineering plan to launch the country &apos;s first mars probe in the 2020 window .
according to hudazhe , although china &apos;s aircraft has entered deep space , but the completion of the mission is still indispensable , detection of mars means that china from the real sense into the deep space exploration era .
&quot; every two or three years , there is a chance that mars will be able to launch the mars probe at this point in time , which is the most energy-saving for a launch vehicle , &quot; he said .
&quot; given the quality of the mars probe , the launch mission will be completed by our china &apos;s long march no . fifth launch vehicle . &quot;
the mission of mars exploration in china is to be rounded , landed and inspected at once , and this form has never been done abroad , and it has been proposed to be rounded and landed , but the landing failed .
there are many technical areas involved in mars exploration , and , in particular , although the rover is a space detector , it has distinct characteristics compared with the general space probe .
that is to say , the mars rover has the ability to determine the route and the danger of discovering obstacles .
part , a researcher at the five academy of china aerospace technology group , said that the reason why humans are so popular with mars exploration is that it has important scientific , technological and other implications , even for the future of mankind .
mars has now become the planet with the highest level of human research beyond earth , and the history of mars exploration by using space probes has been almost throughout the history of human spaceflight .
as a result , humans hope to build a living base on mars and eventually immigrate to mars , turning it into a second home for mankind .
there are plenty of signs that mars , like the current earth , has only evolved over billions of of years to become thinner , cooler , and drained of water .
as a result , exploration or manned landings on mars can be used to prevent the earth from becoming a second mars for human survival .
as of june 2016 , the world conducted 114 lunar probes and 43 martian probes .
however , since in the 1990 of the 20th century , humans have conducted 18 martian probes , while lunar probes have been conducted only 14 times .
there are currently 5 mars orbiter and 2 mars rover working , but only a 1-month ball orbiter and a lunar lander are working .
the world &apos;s space powers have developed a plan to target the mars system , which shows that today &apos;s mars is hotter than lunar exploration .
on november 5 , 2013 , india launched its first mars probe , &quot; mangarian &quot; , to become asia &apos;s first successful country to detect mars .
&quot; mangarian &quot; is used to study the surface , atmosphere and mineral characteristics of mars to see if there are any signs of methane and life on mars .
the hardest part of this mission is that the probe enters the martian atmosphere , with the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration only one chance .
the mars reconnaissance mission faces many technical challenges , according to general architect sun , director of the mars probe , five yuan of china aerospace technology group .
the atmospheric pressure on mars is very low , with a high degree of uncertainty , only 1 % of the earth &apos;s surface atmosphere .
scientists have not yet got a thorough understanding of the changes and characteristics of storms .
mars often forms dust storms similar to earth &apos;s dust in summer , which can cause a sharp drop in the amount of solar energy the rover receives , and must design a &quot; dormant &quot; model for the rover to wait patiently for the dust storm to pass .
at the same time , the martian atmosphere has a reduced effect on solar illumination , which poses a problem for the energy supply that mars detects .
this requires that the detector &apos;s solar wing area is larger , and it needs to be constantly adjusted to aim for the sun .
also , mars &apos; surface gravity is only 38 % that of the earth , but much more than the gravity of the moon &apos;s surface , so the detectors need greater power .
&quot; the core and hardest part of this mission is the process of the spacecraft &apos;s aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration after it enters the martian atmosphere , with only one chance to ensure success , &quot; he said .
sun said that because the earth and mars far away , the whole process can not be real-time control of the ground , so must rely on the detector to do it autonomously .
because there are not so many propellants to offset that high speed , the slowdown depends on the martian atmosphere when landing on mars , but the martian atmosphere is hard to simulate on the ground .
in general , part said , the way to detect mars is similar to the way the moon is detected , and it is also a &quot; detour , fall , patrol , return &quot; to achieve the goal of manned landing on mars .
since mars is much farther from earth than the moon , exploring mars needs to overcome a series of more complex technical hurdles .
taiwan &apos;s chief executive , lin quan , announced yesterday morning that the &quot; political parties and their accompanying organization &apos;s improper acquisition of property regulations &quot; came into effect today , according to the taiwanese media .
kmt vice chairman jianghi said , &quot; a more than 100-year-old kuomintang , with social commitment and responsibility , will not fail in this way . &quot;

although it has not yet been confirmed , many sources say that apple &apos;s 2016 autumn conference will be held in september , and iphone7 is coming .
although apple did not respond , but the new iphone features , configuration has been the release of news , and even the online iphone7 &quot; real machine model &quot; pictures have .
the next generation of iphone is a &quot; great attention &quot; , hot , tight , rich , no goods ... if you want to buy authentic , you must choose a good channel , for example , suning .
this has exacerbated people &apos;s disappointment with the new phone , &quot; it lengthened , but could not project holograms at all ! &quot; this generation of iphones sucks .
iphone7 , like other iphones , accompanied with countless secrets before birth .
in addition , there are several sources claiming that the next-generation iphone will cancel the 3.5mm headphone connector and instead use the bluetooth connection and charging interface , which will provide space for apple to add a second speaker .
another piece of evidence to support the news is that , as early as 2014 , apple allowed headphones makers to produce headphones that were connected by a charging interface .
the news is true or false , and the answer will not be revealed until apple &apos;s 2016 fall launch .
but that does not prevent the industry from bullish on iphone7 &apos; s prospects – many believe iphone7 will likely become apple &apos;s last big upgrade to the iphone series .
the market share of the iphone has slipped , although data from idc , a recent market research agency , have been reported .
goldman sachs has maintained a &quot; buy &quot; rating for apple &apos;s shares , while bmo analysts say iphone7 will reap a historic sales performance .
at the same time , hock tan , ceo of bo tong , said apple &apos;s future revenue growth could be more than 20 % , thanks to the iphone7 launch .
7 % of respondents said they had plans to buy iphone7 , compared with only 4 % of the number of people who planned to buy iphone6 two years ago .
it is understood that currently holds iphone6 or 6plus user groups have 20 % plans to purchase iphone7 , which is a fairly high proportion .
second , with expert analysis , most of the fruit powder likes to replace their own iphone .
according to statistics , of all iphone users , about 26 % of users have not changed their phones for 2 years , that is , almost 120 million of users of the iphone has been used for 2 years .
the media said that during the iphone7 production , taiwan suffered several earthquakes , &quot; tsmc &apos;s production facilities were more damaged than imagined , and could have an impact on the initial iphone7 supply . &quot;
the contradiction between supply and demand will affect ordinary users , it is time to choose a good channel , the first time low price to start the authentic iphone7 .
according to people familiar with the information , recently , suning high-level and apple company frequently meet , the purpose is to prepare sufficient supply .
operators have talked with su ning , it can be foreseen that , with the depth of cooperation between the two sides will inevitably bring lower prices and more intimate services to users .
&quot; the lowest price , the consumer may be &apos; just 7 yuan a day , you can buy iphone7 . &quot;
sufficient supply and diversity of concessions , so that the purchase of iphone7 no longer &quot; pressure &quot; , and suning &apos;s logistics , it will make this beautiful into a more intuitive experience .
perhaps , you will receive the phone at midnight , &quot; hello , suning easy to buy , your iphone7 arrived . &quot;

laiyun , director of national bureau of statistics and statistics , said that in july , some indicators of the national economy slowed down , but still operating in a reasonable range .
statistics released by the national bureau of statistics show that july fixed assets investment growth , total imports and other data fell .
laiyun said that on the national economy in the july , i would like to borrow the words of the prime minister has said that &quot; the shape of volatility , the trend is still good &quot; , which can better summarize the characteristics of the july economic operation .
he explained that &quot; form fluctuation &quot; means that some of the growth rate of economic indicators in july did fall .
since july domestic and foreign economy is still in the depth adjustment , the international situation is complex and changeable , the world economy recovery is not expected , so the export pressure is still relatively big .
from the domestic situation , the whole economy is still at the critical stage of adjustment , the pain of adjustment is released , the economy is facing a big downward pressure , so some of the indicators are somewhat volatile .
laiyun pointed out that there is a special situation in july , the flood disaster is more serious , high temperature and heat weather on some areas of production and operation has brought some impact .
according to the ministry of civil affairs recently released the situation , more than 60 million people nationwide disaster , direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan .
from the relevant indicators of industry , investment and transportation , these areas are affected in varying degrees .
in july , the volume of goods turnover slowed down by 3.6 % last month , and the flood disaster had a certain impact on the traffic in these areas .
judging from these factors , the volatility of some of the july indicators is also normal and is expected .
he said , &quot; the potential is still good &quot; means that despite the slowdown in economic growth , but the overall smooth economic operation , stability in the direction of the good trend has not changed .
july cpi rose 1.8 % , the chain rose 0.2 % ; 1-july cpi rose 2.1 % , so the price situation is generally stable .
according to the chongqing meteorological bureau portal network on the high temperature of the statistics , in addition to youyang , the rest of our city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance .
at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the criteria for granting allowances , although the standards are not the same , while chongqing receives the high temperature allowance in the form of a high temperature working day allowance .
35 shan above 37 shan , per person per day not less than 10 yuan standard issued , 37 shan above , per person per day not less than 15 yuan standard issued .
40 shan above the high temperature staff can receive a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan / day ( except that the worker has already enjoyed the high temperature work allowance according to law ) .
according to this standard , last month high temperature weather days the most open state can receive 330 yuan , the minimum number of days of chengkou is 80 yuan , and youyang the highest temperature due to not meet the high temperature standard , so there is no high temperature allowance .
in the past , a number of flats will be charged with the high temperature allowance with cool drinks , the bureau said .
the employing unit shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the laborers because of the high temperature and the shortening of working time .
city people &apos;s bureau said that staff encountered high temperature work but did not receive the high temperature allowance , can be through the enterprise &apos;s labor dispute mediation institutions to seek legal rights , or call 12333 complaints .
if the employer refuses to grant the high temperature allowance , the worker may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level .
at the same time , because the high temperature allowance is a part of wages , not benefits , to be included in payroll , deduction of tax .
therefore , the high temperature allowance is not in the minimum wage range , must be issued in cash form , can not use beverages and other physical substitutes .

gracian is an eruption of female giant beak bird , all over the atmosphere of the rainforest .
in the central american country costa rica , the gracian and its story has long been a household name .
at the august 10 press conference , the gracian of postoperative recovery finally unveiled its brand-new 3d print-plastic beak .
the giant beak , which had been broken up by a 1.5 ago and was dying , has now finally been reborn .
not only did this day proclaim that it was 100 % restored to health , it was the day when it moved into the luxury aviary and met with the human friends who cared for it .
first entered the new home of the gracian slightly shy , but not too much to become lively , in the water basin , roll frolic , with a new beak to eat grapes .
to remind people of the damage it had suffered , the technician did not paint its new beak , but retained the original white of the 3d printing material .
outside the beak is a thin layer of cutin sheath , inside hollow , only some thin bone supporting rod staggered arrangement .
despite this internal reinforcement , the beak of a giant beak is fragile and broken when it is hurt .
the animal rescue center , a bird biologist and a us 3d printing company worked together to produce several &quot; test beaks &quot; for gracian , finally creating the &quot; perfect beak &quot; best suited to it .
now gracian is adept at using new beaks to drink , eat , and even peck up tiny grains .
&quot; the final finished product was designed for about 2 months , and it only takes 4 or 5 hours to print out . &quot;
&quot; 3d printing is not the technology of the future , it has actually come into your life . &quot; sg3d printing company chairman thomas lange in an interview with xinhua international reporter said .
in january 2015 , a farm in gracian , a alajuela province in central costa rica , was found to be a blood-soaked giant beak gracian .
its upper beak was brutally broken by a gang of young men , and it was utterly incapable of eating and dying .
gracian &apos;s horror was reported in the media , in costa rica and outside the cause of the wave of opposition to cruelty to animals .
stricter animal-protection laws and tougher punishments for abusers are called for .
people come spontaneously and do their best to help gracian to recover as much as possible before the injury .
even 3d print technology inventor chuck hall was involved in the design of gracian &apos;s beak .
&quot; the gracian is very special , and its upper beak is less than 1 centimeters , so it &apos;s a lot of trouble to install new beaks . &quot;
&quot; we scanned the gracian and then designed and produced an elongated prosthesis that was slightly longer than the remainder of its upper beak , which was glued to its upper beak . &quot;
&quot; this can reduce further invasive damage to the gracian , &quot; langer told xinhua international .
before installing the prosthesis , the worker cleans up the beak for gracian every day to prevent infection .
far away , the story of giant beak bird gracian moved the famous documentary filmmaker paula la heredia and discovery news channel producer john hoffmann .
they recorded the dribs and drabs of gracian &apos;s new beak , recording a documentary &quot; the kingdom of the giant beak &quot; , which was broadcast on the animal planet channel this month .
the country of the giant beak shows how a tiny giant beak can change a country and involve its citizens in the fight against cruelty to animals .

on some nights , the ionosphere is full of free electrons , which means that radio signals can go farther .
the u.s. air force is interested in the effect of replication , according to the website of the popular science magazine august 11 .
while the ionosphere , which has a stable mass of free electrons , can help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station , that may not be the interest of the u.s. air force .
the electron-filled ionosphere means that the military uses a greater range of radios , and it may provide some protection from the global positioning system ( gps ) signals from solar storms .
the ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites based on demand , which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed .
but first , the team that signed the contract with the air force must demonstrate that the scientific principles will work .
industry data show that 2015 coal production capacity of nearly 6 billion tons , the national coal production capacity of 1.8 billion tons .
in recent ten years , the state council has issued a total of 5 times before and after the elimination of excess and backward production capacity notice .
although the first 4 times did not target the coal industry , but the target industry directly related to the coal industry .
last november to this january , qinhuangdao 5500 kcal power coal prices for a long time in 370 yuan / ton low hovering , 90 % of coal enterprises into a loss .
and since february , coal prices have gradually picked up , the recent qinhuangdao power coal price is continuously rising around , rose to a 16-month high , once climbed to 436 yuan per ton , a rise of nearly 70 yuan .
as the price picks up , all the worries come along : will a batch of small coal mines return to resuming production ?
in this respect , china ( hainan ) reform and development institute of economic director kao xianming analysis and interpretation .
kao xianming : to production capacity has aroused the attention of all parties , the coal industry released today to the production capacity of the report card also really make everyone feel more worried .
the three-layer factor reflects the relative lag of our growth patterns in the past , where the government-led growth pattern has not yet undergone a fundamental shift .
second , this is directly related to the promotion of local government , in the process of going to capacity , funds and corresponding measures are to be in place , from this perspective , the difference between different regions is indeed relatively large .
third , if some of the provinces that are slower now are going to catch up in the second half of the year , they may face greater risks .
in this case , the process of boosting the capacity by relying on the central prize for funding may have some negative effects .
first of all , go to capacity is not simple to carry out total control .
our aim is to reconstruct the new industry of the whole coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity and promoting structural optimization .
in the process of deployment to capacity , the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the related services .
secondly , in order to complete this year &apos;s capacity task , we should give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative monitoring .
finally , we should strengthen the reveals role of social security .
because the market directly involves the problem of employment , we should strengthen the employment skills training for employees and workers .

ningzetao &apos;s performance in the semi-finals of the 100-metre freestyle has made many chinese audiences silent .
in the 50-metre freestyle preliminaries , ningzetao once again refreshed people &apos;s &quot; bottom line . &quot;
in fact , 50 meters freestyle is not ningzetao items , his performance in the kazan world championships and the best results , but also decided that his project to make a breakthrough is unlikely .
sure enough , hong kong &apos;s authoritative media , the big communiqué , revealed that the biggest reason for ningzetao &apos;s failure was that he had lost interest in swimming .
many factors outside the field may have had a big impact on his ideas for the future , and he is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle .
kazan world championships , ningzetao by virtue of its super high value and good results , instant become a net red .
thus , &quot; national husband &quot; , &quot; small meat &quot; , &quot; pattern of the united states &quot; and other forms of address has become his label .
a variety of business activities to find the door , the good money , become a glittering road .
in this case , ningzetao even choose to retire at this time to join the entertainment circle , is not only his freedom , but also a plausible path .
after all , he is only 23 years old , after a certain amount of study , can rely on his popularity to play one or two tv dramas .
but ningzetao need to see , oneself and these predecessors compared , not have enough qualifications ?
the 2000 sydney olympics , the 21-year-old xuan has come to the end of his career .
xuan &apos;s beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered and laid the groundwork for her future foray into the entertainment circle .
after retiring , xuan starred in a number of tv dramas and set up his own studio in 2013 .
tian participated in the two olympic games single two-person 10-meter competition , and won 2 gold 2 silver .
but after losing to teammate hu jia in the 2004 olympic games single 10-meter competition , tian &apos;s athletic state declined and was fired by the diving team .
and he and his daughter to participate in &quot; dad to where &quot; and other variety shows , but also let him earn enough eyeballs .
once the gymnastics gold generation yang , xiaopeng and yibing all high-profile participate in various variety shows .
it is worth mentioning that , yang xiaopeng then led china to win the 2008 olympic games nan champion , yang is two times to get a personal all-around gold , known as the almighty king .
while yibing led china to the 2012-year olympic group championship , it also became the king of the rings .
and in the london olympic games suffered a miscarriage of justice after the loss of gold , yibing magnanimous move , also let him circle powder countless .
but the athletes &apos; main energy is still on the field , and for the variety show is just like a superficial-touch off .
but whether it is retired or active athletes , to be able to get the favor of the entertainment circle need to get the results to do the protection .
after all , the athlete enters a new field , whether ability or network , is a blank state .
even the &quot; old man &quot; , who has been in the entertainment circle for many years , is tian and xuan , and the average audience is still thinking about their performance at the olympics .
and yang , xiaopeng and other new , in the variety show when the introduction , no exception is &quot; olympic champion . &quot;
compared to the above several people , ningzetao a swimming world champion &apos;s first name still slightly thin .
moreover , compared to tian , xuan , yang and other people &apos;s career , ningzetao if in 23 years of age , a little setback in sports life jiliuyongtui , the image of its negative impact is probably immeasurable .
after all , to mention the athletes , people &apos;s requirements are &quot; not to seek the invincible , but for the sake of difficulties , &quot; ningzetao distance this point is still a lot worse .
10,000 step back said , ningzetao long handsome , can rely on the value of beauty to obtain thousands of brain residue powder support .
no point of skill , only rely on the appearance , want to mix in the entertainment circle , this difficulty is not better than good training back to the state is difficult .
the way of life choice depends on the individual will , but in the end how to choose , ningzetao heart should have several .

in late august , japan &apos;s prime minister , shinzo abe , is to attend the sixth session of the african development conference in kenya , according to the chinese voice , news of the evening peak .
the african development conference , dominated by japan , was preceded by five meetings in tokyo or yokohama , so the conference will be the first to move to africa .
japanese foreign ministry officials said the local meeting in africa helped draw attention from african and european countries to japan .
to coincide with mr. abe &apos;s three visit , the ldp will send a parliamentary group to the countries concerned , according to kyodo news .
it is no coincidence that japan &apos;s &quot; frequent &quot; road began in the early 90 , when the african development conference , launched by japan , also started in 1993 .
africa has 53 seats in the united nations and is an important ticket for the united nations , and how can japan abandon africa if it wants to be &quot; regular &quot; ?
an exchange of views will also be exchanged with interested parties on the extreme organization of &quot; islamic states &quot; and terrorist tactics .
the western group will visit 7 countries , including sierra leone , liberia and guinea-bissau .
japan &apos;s foreign-kishida bank has also recently stated its intentions in the un security council on the african development conference .
mr abe has announced here that it will provide 100 billion yen ( about 6.1 billion yuan ) of aid in 5 years for the stability of sub-saharan africa .
observers generally believe that japan has been generous to africa for two purposes : to increase japan &apos;s sense of presence in africa , and to win the support of african countries on the issue .
&quot; from a political point of view , africa , although relatively underdeveloped , has a larger number of countries , so japan has always regarded it as a so-called &apos; large field &apos; , &quot; said yang bojiang , a japanese expert .
in the future , japan will not give up , and its work on africa will not be terminated .
economic aspect , because japan &apos;s production capacity is relatively strong , but the domestic market is comparatively limited , especially at present in the background of the minority aging , domestic demand is relatively sluggish .
however , from junichiro koizumi , 10 ago , to abe , 10 years later , japan has repeatedly launched the &quot; sprint &quot; , but all failed to return .
japan &apos;s expert yang bojiang believes that japan &apos;s intention to glance at the usual , but the road to the usual will be difficult .
in order to achieve its goal , japan must first make good relations with neighboring countries , in which the japanese need to have a correct attitude , whether in the geopolitical contest or in the national dispute and the historical understanding .

she kept the world first in the tennis rankings for 8 consecutive years and was the longest-running female athlete in the history of table tennis .
september 26 , 2010 , deputy secretary-general of people &apos;s daily and the general manager of the popular search network ag , the stall-level cadres .
recently , she will join hands with yu to create the first domestic sports industry innovation platform .
chinese sports also have such a group of star coaches : they are in the athletes era of unlimited glory for the country to win countless , after the retirement will be taught for many years later , to cultivate the winner .
as the first world champion of chinese men &apos;s gymnastics , huang chose to pick up the pointer after retiring .
from the female team coach to the male team coach , then to head coach , huang built an &quot; olympic gold regiment &quot; , the more rate team in the beijing olympic games won 9 gold 1 silver 4 bronze myth record .
since then , tian has been advertising endorsements , but also in recent years played a &quot; cowboy &quot; , &quot; lei feng &quot; and other important roles .
many nba players have proved their strength . but some progress has been made to decline .
whether it &apos;s because of the age or the time limit , there are some players who will show a setback every season .
of course , some &quot; backwards &quot; may just be the shrinking of the data , and the players &apos; strength may not fall .
even though wade is still one of the league &apos;s best scoring guards , his performance at the bulls should not be as good as the heat .
he and rondo have a limited range of the back field , the star butler &apos;s three-point hit is only 32.8 % , which makes them very crowded next season &apos;s attack .
came to the windy city , the lightning man will be more than the ball to butler and long , he is likely to choose in the regular game regimen .
okafor &apos;s situation was awkward and , as the first choice for 76 people last season , he had to compete with simmons and embid in the new season .
this competition may not come quickly , simmons also needs to adapt to the nba arena , embid also want to recover from the injury as soon as possible , but the okafor can be 76 people in the long array of positions is still a problem .
last season , okafor &apos;s 32 % score came from a low level offense , which was higher than caucins , vucevic and brook lopes , while his use was high in the top 40 .
as simmons has shown excellent control striker potential , embid also has a better fit for the nba game , and okafor &apos;s position may be hard to stabilize .
in the past two seasons , thompson &apos;s usage has stabilized in the top 20 of the league , which is the best two seasons of his life .
the problem , however , is that with durant &apos;s arrival , thompson &apos;s usage rate will surely drop , which will affect his play .
this effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots , tang shin &apos;s ball attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced , which in some ways will reduce the opponent &apos;s defense difficulty .
durant &apos;s arrival will certainly make the warriors &apos; figures shrink , but the worst part of the squeeze is thompson .
but that does not mean that tang shin &apos;s level of decline is more likely to make a sacrifice for the team as a whole .
parker &apos;s performance last season was better than the data , not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level , he and aldridge &apos;s chemistry also benefited the spurs .
duncan retired , and gino announced another year of war , the combination of gdp finally came to an end , as the youngest of three people , the french sports car is not much oil in the tank .
after winning the third championship ring , only kareem abdul-jabbar , jordan and rasselbijams won more regular mvp , and jordan was the only one fmvp james dore .
oh , yes , james has just brought cleveland the first professional sports champion trophy in the last 52 years .
james , who has come to the 14th season of his career , needs to be better prepared for the playoffs .
so in the regular season , james &apos; data is likely to fall further and he will take more of the burden to owen , but he will still be easily the top three player in the league .
&quot; be sure to learn from the domestic talent in russia . &quot;
12th local time , the chairman of the moscow overseas chinese federation huang in the see beijing reporter excitedly said .
not long ago , she participated in the national chinese affairs office of the state council of china , jinan university sponsored by the &quot; overseas chinese cultural community chinese talent ( calligraphy , painting ) training courses . &quot;

nayanwe , the secretary-general of the russian association for the promotion of chinese culture , also has the same feeling .
she said that she has made great progress with the help of the teachers in the training course , and also felt the heavy responsibility as &quot; the overseas disseminator of chinese culture &quot; .
nayanwe said that after returning to russia , he must spread and promote the chinese traditional culture among the chinese and the russians who love chinese culture .

the british won the silver medal in the seven-man rugby , and fiji won the gold medal .
in the final of the seven-man rugby game in the evening of thursday , the british team was defeated by fiji in 43 : 7 at the riotio doro stadium after failing to perform well before fiji .
fiji won the gold medal for its impeccable performance in possession , interception , avoidance , co-ordination , running and strength , the first olympic medal in the country &apos;s history .
the silver medal was a great consolation to the defeated british team , the silver medal was the third silver medal that the british delegation won that day . the result was enough to make the english olive team proud : they beat new zealand , argentina and south africa in the first seven-man rugby game to enter the olympics .
earlier in the day , the british team narrowly defeated south africa by 7 : 5 , which could affect their status in the final .
but in any case , the fiji team is now enough to beat a 15-person team .
tomorrow , at least one englishman will be wearing a gold medal , which may be a consolation to the british team , but it may not be . the englishman , the head of the fiji team from wimbledon , was coach ben rein , who served as england &apos;s coach .
it is not easy for the british team to achieve today &apos;s results .
eight years ago , under the coaching of ryan , they had no victory at the international rugby sevens game .
now they are only one step away from the championship .
although they were hit hard , they made remarkable progress .
fiji took advantage of the opening , making the british team defenseless .
for mitchell and his teammates , it &apos;s like hitting a series of buses that are on the way . when oci kolineso stormed into the corner , the world series champions were already ahead of the 5 : 0 .
only four minutes after the game , jerry tuway again scored on the right .
12 : 0 , the british team has barely touched the ball .
mitchell &apos;s strong interdiction made the giant lyon nakarava not score a third time , but it just slowed fiji &apos;s score .
in 7 minutes , the assa willemaru is in the right corner . 17 : 0 , the british team is worse .
the caravaggio scored another point , and the race ... had 1 minutes left in the first half .
then , vatmo ravovo broke through the english team &apos;s defense , straight to the scoring line .
at half-time , the score was 29 : 0 .
the fijians were born to play 7-man football , and the british team was still a rookie .
this is the case .
the british team made a big change in the second half and hit the fijian line for the full four minutes , which was good for the first half . but then fiji played a wonderful match and scored again by joshua tuesova .
dan norton for the british team to create a scoring opportunity , he touched the ground in the left corner , the score changed to 36 : 7 , but the game has long been in the south china sea island control , their fans on the platform singing loudly , waving flags , singing and dancing .
the fiji team &apos;s wonderful performance had to be applaud .
mattha william at the last minute stopped the fiji team from an indifferent attack .
the final whistle sounded , the fijian embraced together , and the defeated british team can only regret the exit .
earlier in the day , fiji defeated the japanese team in 20 : 5 in the semi-final , while britain narrowly edged out south africa in a fierce semi-final clash .
the first half brown helped south africa to get ahead , but dan norton scored in the second half with a good footwork .
then england &apos;s anthony &apos;s brother , marcus watson , ensured the team &apos;s victory with a brilliant intercept and eventually the british team won the silver medal .
helen goe love and heather stenning , encouraged by the cancer coach , won the rowing gold medal .
it is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the most moving gold medals .
from the first paddle to the present , helen goe love and heather stenning have received 220 punitive training , and their gold medal in estacio da lagoa has a more remarkable significance .
though they were the only two to paddle , there were a of them on board--coach robin--who had been accompanying them for the second consecutive women &apos;s double paddle olympic gold medal , which was the uk &apos;s first to reach this height of the rowing women &apos;s combination .
they have maintained 39 unbeaten records and have an absolute advantage .
what we see is that these two talented athletes are walking gracefully on the water , but that &apos;s not the whole story .
there are many volunteers behind every gold medal , and it is their constant devotion that makes a difference , and the greatest help is a coach who learned that he had cancer 30 months ago and did not know if he could live to see the day .
as he said , death may come at any moment .
i had bladder cancer and they operated on me .
if you do not operate , the cancer cells will spread throughout the body .
in this way , the situation will be much worse .
this will change your mind slightly .
williams was diagnosed with cancer in december 2013 .
luckily , he started treatment in early 2014 , minimizing the impact , although in this case it might not be appropriate to say so .
i need to get paid , so i have to hurry up .
it &apos;s an inspiration to me .
i live in a hospital , and although they say it &apos;s enough to walk a few steps , i walk 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet every time i go around the ward .
this is the beginning of everything .
the rowing movement itself was a journey , which made the journey a little longer .
the first thing they thought of at the time of the gold medal was williams . williams was slightly talkative this morning than usual , to overcome his anxiety .
&quot; i was in a bad mood this week and might be a bit extreme , but the gold medal really meant a lot , &quot; she said , after stanning , a former royal artillery team , headed for afghanistan .
it repeatedly told me how important it was to me , how much effort i , helen , and robin had made .
this is helen , robin and i have been trying for three years in return .
without robin , we &apos;re just nobody , thank him very much , he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
i can &apos;t find a better trainer and coach than him .
helen goe love and heather stenning were undefeated in five years .
the penalties set by the combination are unmatched by their rivals .
even at the end of the 500 metres , new zealand and denmark are approaching , stanning and graff still have plenty of physical reserves .
it was so thrilling .
helen shouted : &quot; keep the rhythm , keep the rhythm . &quot;
it is really important not to be affected by your opponents .
we have a good start , and we are not looking forward to doing something big and earthshaking .
we did not think of today &apos;s glory , we just wanted to paddle each oar and win the game , and we did it .
the combination took one years to determine your future .
graff will marry the tv explorer steve buckshar next month .
but now , she just wants to enjoy the moment .
i don &apos;t want to say it &apos;s my last game .
this will bring me too much pressure .
in london , it took me about six months to realize that i was the olympic champion .
it was a whole new experience and i felt very nervous .
it has now elapsed for about 4 minutes .
&quot; i feel much better , &quot; she says .

snapchat &apos;s &quot; anime &quot; effect is meant to be ironic to asians .
snapchat said the filter was inspired by animation , but some observers thought it was racially colored .
snapchat &apos;s 150 million of everyday users can change the reality through their filter tools and make the person funny .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dogs or a roy lichtenstein painting .
these lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics , resulting in more than 30 million modified self-portraits per day .
any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public .
snapchat lenses have been criticized for being used to agitate to play black or white skin .
so , when the application this week provided a filter for some users to create a squint , a weird tooth , and a powder face effect , some commentators called it a racial satire on asian &quot; yellow people &quot; .
they even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has big problems with diversity .
after snapchat said it had removed the feature , the verge and motherboard report sparked outrage in wednesday .
the company &apos;s explanation is that the filter is a tribute to the anime characters , not the irony of asians .
but for those who have experienced racism , the filter reminds them of a real , hurtful stereotype .
others are adamantly opposed to these anime images .
a korean-american art student who published twitter and was widely shared in the photos said the filters were &quot; at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable &quot; .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to tell the difference between an extremely disgusting asian satire and a filter , &quot; she says .
although the filter is not only yellow people , but the yellow people are extremely degraded .
snapchat is not the only company that touches the bottom line of these cultures .
from corporate boardrooms to hollywood and the equipment we carry , american culture seems to have been advocating diversity and inclusiveness .
snapchat &apos;s vast young population is likely to be very sensitive because of its greater focus on ethnic diversity than the older generation .
when one of snapchat &apos;s filters produced an insult to users , 25-year-old juketi said in an interview in thursday : &quot; these things are harder to escape than they were before . &quot;
ms zhu , who acted as product manager and engineer at medium in thursday , decided to delete her snapchat account and encourage others to do the same .
in a articles written for medium and a telephone interview , she said she thought racial controversy reflected a lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process by snapchat .
ms. zhu criticized the company &apos;s employees for the majority of whites , the leadership all male and added a label at the end of the article : chideletesnapchat .
as a chinese-american , ms zhu said : &quot; either they don &apos;t have a variety of people in their workforce , so they can make this decision , or there are some colored people in their staff , but their positions won &apos;t let them speak freely . &quot;
other observers shared complaints that she had not been snapchat .
the company did not release data on the diversity of its workforce and said it was a private company .
snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic background of its employees in thursday , but a spokeswoman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the lower-level population and to promote internal inclusiveness .
ms zhu said she would close her snapchat account : &quot; i want to know if they need more users like us against this behavior . &quot;
congressional panel says military officials distort isis &apos;s intelligence
a congressional team in a report released in thursday noted that u.s. central command officials have changed intelligence reports , describing the war situation in iraq and syria against islamic countries as more optimistic than the actual situation .
the interim report comes from a house armed services committee , the intelligence committee and the house appropriations committee , the republican chairman of the defense subcommittee , set up a special working group . the report said the central command intelligence analysts had &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; , which said their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the war between the united states and the islamic nation .
the central command ( centcom ) , located in florida state tampa , is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing u.s. military operations in the middle east and central asia .
according to a report on the news , &quot; the intelligence that has been vetted by senior leaders at the central command has been more optimistic about u.s. counterterrorism operations than it is , and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies . &quot;
california state the republican representative said : &quot; the central command &apos;s behaviour is unacceptable . one side is our warriors suffer from war , the other side is the senior policy makers received the wrong analysis . &quot;
the leadership issues of the central command have been extended to the highest level of the agency .
the report details the long-standing problems of the 2014 and 2015 central command in describing and analysing the united states training of iraqi troops .
while there is no certainty that the obama administration &apos;s top officials have ordered the changes , the analysts feel they are under pressure from central command leaders to make them more optimistic about the threat of the islamic state ( isis or isil ) , according to the report .
&quot; in the first half of 2015 , many central command press releases , statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than the actual situation , &quot; the report said .
for example , a central command official said publicly that it was possible to take a major military operation to retake mosul as early as april 2015 or may .
almawsil , iraq &apos;s second-largest city , is still under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; after months of investigation , the results are clear , &quot; the kansas republican representative , michael peo , said in a statement .
since the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , most senior intelligence officers at the u.s. central command have manipulated the command &apos;s intelligence products , concealing the threat of the islamic state of iraq .
the republican party has set up a special working group to learn from analysts about the manipulation of islamic intelligence .
as the investigation continues , there will be more discoveries following the report released in thursday .
the attorney general of the ministry of defence also conducted a long-term investigation into the central command .
democratic members of the house intelligence committee published their findings in thursday , in line with some of the conclusions of the republican ad hoc working group .
in a statement , the committee &apos;s democratic leader , cheandar , said : &quot; during the period from 2014 to 2015 , the central command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of islamic and iraqi peacekeepers . &quot;
mr cheandar says the process &quot; interferes with the release of intelligence &quot; , lowers analyst morale and &quot; cannot accept different opinions . &quot;
but mr cheandar and democrats said they had found no evidence that the white house was trying to put pressure on analysts at central command , and that their conclusions were consistent with &quot; presupposition or political narratives . &quot;
the beast daily reported the preliminary results of congressional investigation in tuesday .
last august , the new york times reported that after receiving a complaint from a central command analyst , the pentagon attorney general began an investigation .
pentagon spokesman navy major patrick evans said in a statement that the pentagon did not comment on the congressional report until the attorney-general &apos;s investigation was completed .
but he said : &quot; experts sometimes disagree over the interpretation of complex data , and intelligence agencies and the ministry of defence encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes . &quot;
the impact of the survey exceeded the success of u.s.-led bombing operations in iraq and syria , as more and more defense officials claimed .
but last year , these assertions raised questions about the extent to which president obama could trust the assessment of military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis areas issued by the central command .
the criticism of islamic intelligence was reminiscent of the controversy more than 10 years ago , when central command analyst gregory hucker wrote a research articles pointing out that george bush &apos;s government , despite the objections of many analysts , insisted on sending small-scale troops to iraq and had little consideration of the aftermath of the 2003 invasion .
mr hooker played a key role in the opposition to islamic intelligence .
last year , officials said mr. hooker &apos;s team concluded that the air strikes against the islamic state &apos;s refineries did not significantly reduce the economic revenues of terrorist groups , as the terrorist group built a temporary refinery to continue to sell oil on the black market , which was in stark contrast to the announcement .
according to time magazine &apos;s september report , the central command did not disclose the discovery .
the commander of central command lloyd o austin iii was criticized last year after a number of lawyers reviewed the senate testimony on the overly optimistic assessment of the war .
general austin retired in april and is now joseph wattel to replace his position at central command .
us wins four in women &apos;s hockey games
in the 6 : 1 victory over japan , katie bam , a triple-a-brace , took the lead in thursday for the american women &apos;s hockey team to help the us team win the indian team by 3 : 0 .
two of the five goals were four , but bam , 27 , said she didn &apos;t know she was doing so well .
&quot; i don &apos;t know anything about it , &quot; she says .
i &apos;m not the kind of person who remembers how many goals i &apos;ve scored .
what she knows is that the united states has won four consecutive games in the olympics and will compete with the team for the first team in england after winning the 2 : 0 victory over japan in thursday .
britain and the united states were in the first round of the last game in saturday .
both teams qualify for the one-fourth finals , which will determine who is to be the first in the group .
the team that won the first team will avoid a strong holland team and be able to go further . the netherlands is in the first position of another group .
in the saturday game , the american team created miracles with astonishing performance . to know that at the london olympics four years ago , the united states was at the bottom of 12 teams .
bam was in the same team .
bam cheng , who was the youngest member of the national team to date , was the first to pick up a lacrosse bat ( her twin sister in drexel ) at the age of 3 and join the national team at the age of 16 .
she missed the 2008 olympics because she failed to shortlist the final list .
2012 , she and her teammates are not optimistic .
the next year , the british craig pannam as head coach , all began to change .
&quot; this is a cultural , psychological and substantive change , &quot; said bam .
we had not yet reached the current level in london .
we came to a full end .
in the evening of thursday , bam scored first in a near-range backhand .
india &apos;s game has not yet won , but the team showed a surprisingly strong fighting spirit and kept the 1 : 0 score to the end of the third quarter when bam broke up .
she took the ball along the left side of the stadium long distance strikes , then cut to the middle road , volley net , the united states team 2 : 0 lead .
melissa gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter .
in the first three victories , the united states scored a goal for the goalkeeper jackie briggis in 0 opponents in this competition .
this time she was an extraordinary play .
bam , too .
&quot; we are in good shape now , &quot; says panam . &quot; but how good is it depends on the results of the saturday game . &quot;
the shabby food of the great depression during the feast
in march 1933 , roosevelt , who had just been elected president , sat in the oval office to enjoy his lunch .
as a gourmet , president roosevelt liked the cuisine of the five-mile road , such as foie gras and maryland stew .
on that day , his menu was simple : tomato sauce , devil &apos;s egg , mashed potatoes and candied pudding for dessert .
&quot; it &apos;s about eating and suffering people , &quot; jean zigman says .
her husband , cuomo , added : &quot; this also reflects the way americans eat . &quot;
the couple , who live in brooklyn heights , are food historians .
mr. ke &apos;s last book , &quot; fried chowder &quot; , is about american chinese food , and ms. ziegman in her &quot; 97 orchards &quot; book to tell the life stories of slum tenants through food .
their new book , &quot; sumptuous feast &quot; , will be published in tuesday by harper press , a book about food history in the great depression .
after showing some common insights on food , they met a journalist at eisemberg &apos;s sandwich shop . the simple lunch counter in the iron district has been open since the economy ran out in 1929 .
ms. ziegman , 54 , ordered a cream cheese and an olive sandwich , while a 57-year-old mr. ke ordered turkey , mashed potatoes and a vegetable platter .
the reporter ordered a meatloaf rolls , which the couple thought were suitable for discussion of the great depression diet .
&quot; the bread was very popular at the time , &quot; ms. ziegman said .
there were peanut bread , liver bread , and soy bread .
they are made of a raw material and a cheap topping that can be poured on the raw material .
imagine your dinner is peanuts .
mr. ke played a strange picture .
&quot; they &apos;re definitely like lead in your stomach , &quot; he says .
in the years before the great depression , american dayton was a buffet , especially in the suburbs .
a group of women cooks for male farm workers , with freshly-tested pies for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
in the first world war , it was the americans who gave food to the hungry europeans . &quot; sumptuous feast &quot; records how the country suddenly ceases to be a rich place .
mr. ke explained why he and his wife were writing the book : &quot; at the time , food had become the main topic of unhappiness for the american people . &quot;
another unpleasant topic is the shabby new food : &quot; fan food &quot; , such as bread and stews , became the main course , and the stew was &quot; the best way to cook leftovers , &quot; ms. ziegman said , because chefs could use the cream in their sauces to cover up the unpalatable ingredients .
fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruits .
the meat that has been leading the american table for years has become a rare luxury .
the odd hodgepodge only considers calories , and the first thing people think about is nutrition rather than taste or even basic culinary common sense .
in the process of studying this book , including various recipes , ms. ziegman made a baked onion stuffed with peanut oil .
&quot; it &apos;s not very common at dinner tables , &quot; says mr .
ms. ziegman said : &quot; this is too strange . &quot;
peanut oil and grilled onion can not match .
this is the hallmark of many family economic meals .
family economists influence the country &apos;s eating habits , such as the louis stanley , who served as head of the federal family economics office from 1923 to 1943 , which is historically unique .
they publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , encouraging women to be &quot; frugal &quot; and daring to turn the cream of spaghetti with carrots and other bad foods into food .
&quot; sumptuous feast &quot; is a sumptuous &quot; historical treasure &quot; .
it is particularly interesting to note the government &apos;s response to the hungry people , such as the president &apos;s people herbert buddha &quot; other people &apos;s things i can not control &quot; attitude .
although he publicly praised the simple iowa farmhouse in his childhood , his diet was as fine as a millionaire .
&quot; he likes to eat european western food , such as fish with cucumber sauce , &quot; says mr .
he was wearing a tuxedo and eating in a gilded restaurant .
he was evidently out of the people .
if not his wife eleanor encouraged him to set an example in his diet , president roosevelt might have made the same mistake .
as the book puts it , ms. roosevelt &apos;s housekeeper had no interest in the taste , so the white house &quot; food is not only the worst food in washington , but the worst food to cook . &quot;
when the united states was a back to normal , many of the great depression-era cuisine was abandoned .
ms. ziegman says what is left is our focus on calories and nutrition and the use of science in cooking .
the couple said they had learned more about ms ziegman &apos;s mother &apos;s eating habits when they wrote the book , such as how she had not discarded the food .
&quot; she &apos;s very afraid of wasting food , &quot; said mr .
&quot; she actually makes many lives sick , &quot; ms. ziegman recalls .
for example , there has been a &quot; cream puff &quot; incident .
after removing the dish , she and mr. ke took out a dessert they had prepared at home : this is the preserved pudding that president roosevelt ate at lunch .
ms. ziegman said : &quot; it &apos;s called the candied fruit , &quot; and adds that a trendy name for a common dish is &quot; the usual trick . &quot;
there is no whipped cream in this dessert , only preserved fruit , one point flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
we all reluctantly pushed the spoon into the sticky brown paste .
surprisingly , the dessert tasted good .
mr. ke ate the second spoon and the third spoon .
he thought it was an acceptable dessert and told his wife , &quot; it would be better to have some walnuts . &quot;
unfortunately , opec &apos;s latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to rise in july and saudi arabia &apos;s output hit a record high .
the report raises doubts about the credibility of opec , which is still fraught with thorns .
in monday , opec &apos;s rotating chairman and qatar energy minister sadah said opec would hold an informal meeting during the international energy forum in september and 26-28th .
opec &apos;s wednesday monthly report showed that opec , including gabon , rose 46,000 barrels / day to 33.11 million barrels per day in july .
opec also said in its monthly report that low crude prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil , exacerbating the extent of oversupply .
the news , coupled with a us increase in crude oil production expectations and an unexpectedly increased oil inventories , have been falling for the second consecutive day .
as of wednesday , the price of light crude oil futures from the new york mercantile exchange fell by 2.48 % in september , and the price of london brent crude , which was delivered in october , fell 2.07 % .
reuters said the proposed oil-producing meeting is unlikely to make the supply significantly tighter , and the data released by the us energy information agency also depress sentiment .
iran &apos;s official news agency , fars , quoted iran &apos;s oil minister in wednesday as saying that iran &apos;s crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels a day , the highest level since 2008 .
news of the meeting came just after russia &apos;s energy minister , novak nowak , said there was no need for a new round of frozen production under the current oil price .
the last time a meeting of oil-producing countries was april , opec members failed to reach an agreement on any measure .
emma richards , bmiresearch oil and gas analyst , said markets and media could overreact to opec meetings .
helima croft , head of commodity strategy at royal bank of canada , said opec would change sentiment by releasing signals that they would facilitate the deal .
this approach is like the smoke and mirrors that draw a person &apos;s eye ( intentionally giving the wrong impression ) .
eugen weinberg , head of commodity research at commerzbank , said there was a low likelihood that opec would try to stabilize the market through the september meeting .
this is likely to further undermine the market &apos;s confidence in opec , after all , the organization has staged a &quot; wolf . &quot;
all localities to the violation of the issue of medical advertisements , complaints centralized , the past is repeatedly punished by the medical institutions as a spot check .
national health commission , the state administration of traditional chinese medicine will be timely organization of some provinces special supervision and inspection work carried out supervision .

according to data from the hong kong centre for management studies at the ellie hospital , internet healthcare companies have died in the one-year period and about 20 % of start-ups have ceased to exist .
however , as most internet healthcare companies struggle to finance a round or b-round financing , several segments of the leading companies still have access to capital .
it seems that the internet medical start-up can not &quot; swarm &quot; , but to look at the market demand , sinking heart to do the special , do deep .
diving capital of 12 million yuan , accounting for 40 % of the registered capital , kyushu tong equipment company contributed 18 million yuan , accounting for 60 % of the registered capital .
in recent years , with the state &apos;s policy support in medical informatization , electronic and integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered all levels of hospitals .
the cooperation between the diving and kyushu is aimed at the demand of the market , to help the hospital to build an advanced supply chain management system , and as a chance to seek more cooperation .
unlike many internet health-care companies , china ibaby from its initial focus on the vertical field of internet obstetrics , deep pregnant moms and doctors .
not only can pregnant mothers be free for 24 hours and one-on-one doctor visits , but also can pay directional medical consultations .
and at the doctor &apos;s end , ibaby through the organization of experts to grassroots doctors on-line lectures , peer exchanges , case discussions and other micro-lectures on the form of breaking the geographical restrictions .
at present , doctors offer three sections for continuing education , doctor &apos;s social and doctor &apos;s help .
provides services including online learning , case discussions , academic exchanges , social platforms with hospitals and physicians , legal aid and entrepreneurial support for physician-patient relationships or personal life .
according to media reports , ceo wang lei recently said ali health &quot; willing to sink heart to &quot; take the health of large data .
the lack of professionalism in internet companies and data companies is not uniform in the way they write on the same entry .
ali currently in the medical and health field of the layout is divided into three pieces , respectively , ali health , the day cat medicine museum and pay treasure future hospital .
wang lei frankly , health care business will be more difficult than other industries , &quot; this is not just how much money , but also to sink the heart , endure loneliness slowly to do . &quot;

during the cold war , the soviet union sent missiles into cuba , almost leading to a nuclear war in the united states .
the incident was seen as the pinnacle of the cold war , known as the &quot; cuban missile crisis &quot; .
but it is little known that during the cold war , too , a strong solar storm narrowly led to a nuclear war against the soviet union , which was not released for the first time by researchers until august 9 .
may 23 , 1967 , a strong solar storm on the u.s. military in the arctic radar and radio communications caused strong interference .
these radars are part of the u.s. ballistic missile early warning system to monitor soviet missiles .
the paper , completed by researchers at the university of colorado , interviewed u.s. personnel involved in the forecast and analysis of solar activity , and consulted unclassified documents .
in the 60 &apos; s , the united states air force has always had a part of a nuclear warhead flying in the sky to prevent the soviet union from suddenly waging a nuclear war , the paper wrote .
the us military commanders were unaware that the main culprit of the disturbance was the solar storm , not the soviet union , and ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness .
fortunately , the u.s. military &apos;s solar activity , which began in the late 50 and its study of earth &apos;s electromagnetic interference , ultimately prevented the potential military conflict .
later , he summarized the information provided by the united states air force aviation meteorological service and submitted a detailed report .
the immediate consequence of this solar storm is that the u.s. military has since seen space weather as a combat concern and has built a more powerful space weather forecast system .

gillied gets a lawyer &apos;s fee in the fight against merck &apos;s hepatitis c patent
according to a u.s. district judge , the company has the right to receive a lawyer &apos;s fee in a patent lawsuit against hepatitis c , a pharmaceutical company in the united states merck group .
in june , after us judges found wrongdoing in merck , including perjury and other unethical practices , he was exempt from paying $ 200 million in compensation for bouvet and havoni , which violated merck &apos;s two patents .
in a lawsuit in thursday , u.s. district judge best lambosson friman said that geely did not have to bear the costs incurred by the defence .
merck is trying to catch up with the new drug market for the new hepatitis c drug , which can cure more than 90 % of patients with hepatitis gillede .
the case dates back to 2013 , when gillied and merck sued each other , claiming that they were the active ingredient in the geely drug , the owner of bouvet &apos;s laboratory work .
u.s.-backed troops have announced they have recaptured mambitti from the islamic state .
a spokesman for the force said in friday that the remaining islamist soldiers in the city had all left , and the united states-backed forces had fully controlled the northern city of manchester , near the turkish border .
the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) are now sweeping through the city after the militants who have been hiding in town have left .

the clintons paid $ 10.75 million for 2015 years , paying a 34.2 % federal tax .
hillary clinton published its 2,105-year tax return in friday , which shows the democratic presidential candidate and her husband earning $ 10.75 million in 2015 years and paying a 34.2 % federal tax .
in 2015 , the clintons &apos; charitable donations amounted to $ 1 million , most of which was donated to the clinton foundation ; former president bill clinton paid nearly $ 5.3 million for his speech , while the former secretary of state earned $ 3 million from the publisher , simon and schuster , with a book on her tenure at the state department .
clinton &apos;s running mate , virginia state kaine and his wife anne holton , announced a 10-year tax return .
the two men paid a federal tax of 20.3 % in 2015 .
clinton &apos;s campaign aide , jennifer palmieri , said in a statement : &quot; hillary clinton and kaine will continue to be the benchmark for financial transparency . &quot;
in stark contrast , mr. donald trump concealed the false reasons and withdrew his promise to publish the tax returns .
although the law is not required , in accordance with established practice , the united states presidential candidates should disclose their tax returns .
as a new york businessman , trump and his lawyer used the irs audit as a reason to refuse to publish a tax return .
clinton &apos;s campaign aide , ian sames , said on twitter that you were in charge and attached a link to the democratic candidate &apos;s tax returns .
in thursday , trump &apos;s special legal advisor , michael cohen , told cnn that he would not allow trump to publish his tax returns until the audit was completed .
critics of trump , including republican presidential nominee mitt romney and other republicans in 2012 , said trump &apos;s refusal to publish tax returns would raise questions about his net worth , charitable donations , business deals and other relationships , including relations with russia .
clinton seized on the issue and launched a network video in friday highlighting high-profile democrats urging trump to announce his tax payments .
she raised the issue in an economic policy speech in michigan in thursday .
&quot; for decades , he refused to publish his tax returns as other presidential candidates , &quot; she told the crowd .
according to the politician &apos;s news network , trump had barely paid a penny in the last two years of the 90 , and the new york times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants in friday , all of whom said the current situation might remain the same .
federal taxes have become a big problem in the presidential race .
clinton named warren buffett , a billionaire investor , with a rule guaranteeing that people who earn more than $ 1 million a year pay at least a 30 % tax .
president obama also supported the proposal .
last week , mr. clinton held a rally at berkshire hathaway &apos;s nebraska state omaha , where mr. buffett asked trump to meet and exchange a tax return .
mr. buffett said he was also being audited by the irs , and trump was &quot; scared &quot; not by tax authorities but by voters .
the first tax returns announced by the clinton campaign group were 2007 years .
the average federal tax rate paid by the clintons in chaback , new york , between 2014 and 2007 amounted to about 32 % , with a combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
the clintons &apos; 2015-year tax returns show that , unlike most americans , they earn only $ 100 in wages .
their main investment is the low cost index mutual fund , and the clintons &apos; dividend and interest income is $ 109,000 .

jewish film producer criticizes berlin hotels to delete israeli phone codes according to arab customers &apos; requirements-reuters news
a french filmmaker with jewish ancestry told the press that the kempinski hotel in berlin did not list israel &apos;s phone codes and that the hotel staff said it was &quot; demanded &quot; by arab customers , sparking a public outcry .
claude londsman , author of the holocaust documentary holocaust , expressed his disappointment with the kempinski hotel and published an open letter in germany &apos;s frankfurt report .
during the recent stay , lanzman wanted to find israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel .
but israel does not have a list of countries where guests can speak directly from the room .
did israel disappear in 2016 in berlin , the capital of germany ?
lanzman wrote .
instead , guests can call israel via the kempinski hotel &apos;s call center .
to seek an explanation , the filmmaker asked the hotel &apos;s front desk .
in his letter , lanzman said he was &quot; shocked &quot; by the answer he received at the reception desk .
hotel staff said it was &quot; a deliberate decision by kempinski hotel management . &quot;
the reason for this is to make the filmmaker angry .
lanzman quotes the employee as saying : &quot; most of our guests are arabs and they want to delete the israeli code . &quot;
israel &apos;s ambassador to germany , yakov haddas handelsman , described the incident as &quot; a disgrace &quot; , according to the daily newspaper .
we were surprised to learn of the incident .
the matter itself is a huge disgrace .
in germany and that chain hotel is a disgrace .
there is no need for any explanation of this .
&quot; we hope the hotel can draw the right conclusions , &quot; the official said .
the incident sparked a heated debate online , and everyone thought it was a scandal .
some people think that kempinski hotel is simply to meet the requirements of arab customers and &quot; grovel . &quot;
another post points to the hotel &apos;s &quot; really shameless face &quot; , pointing out that the main street in the famous kurfuerstendamm street is near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly clarified all charges , claiming that everything was &quot; negligent &quot; and apologized to lanzman , according to the der spiegel report .
&quot; never issued a direct command to remove israel from the speed dial list , &quot; the newspaper quoted the kempinski representative as saying .
the newspaper said the israeli code was added to the list .

in são paulo , brazil , in thursday , students clashed with police over the process of protesting the reform of the government &apos;s public education system .
police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters .
the cause of the incident was the attempt by law enforcement officials to disperse the students , so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas .

just a few days before the recent protests , protesters collectively took to the streets to support president dilma , who was impeached by the state senate .
scottish cyclist karm see skinner wins his bicycle gold medal
karm see skinner , a scottish cyclist , last night at the rio cycling men &apos;s group race helped the trio to defend the olympic gold medal after the 2012 london olympics .
the 23-year-old glasgow cyclist took the place of his scottish compatriot , sir chris hoy , as the backbone of his team . even the legendary cyclist was proud of him when he defeated the new zealand team and returned with honors .
four years ago , the british team blockbuster , and hoy won a personal six olympic gold medal in the fifth .
the british team was ranked sixth in london &apos;s world cycling championships in march , and hoy has since retired . then the british team is more brilliant .
during the beijing olympics to the london olympics , the british team &apos;s problem was to replace the &quot; first circle of experts &quot; jamie stave .
that &apos;s what the team did when be appeared .
hoy &apos;s retirement also left a blank , and chin imadi and matt crampton all wanted to fill the void .
after seeing the potential of skinner , the british men &apos;s team insisted that he be selected for the national team , and skinner was not in the end .
skinner &apos;s partner is be and kenny , who won the gold medal with hoy four years ago . the trio have refreshed the olympic record in qualifying , but the result was overtaken by new zealand in the first round .
the three british cycling championships eventually defeated their opponents and won the gold medal .
although be is slightly behind , but kenny is leading the team , skinner has maintained this leading edge to the last .
the change in strategy was the key to this reversal , and be chose a larger flywheel , so it was slower , which allowed kenny , especially skinner , to keep pace .
hoy watched the game as a bbc commentator . skinner , kenny and be saw him on the podium .
&quot; i &apos;m flattered , &quot; says skinner , 23 , a glasgow cyclist .
i just try my best to make my own fame .
we created the olympic record in the final and defeated the world champion .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
nothing is better than this victory .
after winning gold medals with kenny and hoy at the 2012 london olympics , be admits to falling deliberately on the track in a bad start .
later , he withdrew the comments , and british rivals were unable to appeal .
this victory does not have any such problems .
&quot; it &apos;s like london , and the british flag is on the platform , &quot; be said .
we just got together three months ago .
we &apos;ve lost a lot of world champions , so it &apos;s amazing to be able to defend the olympic champions .
it was just a game and a gold medal for the british team , which won 7 of the 10 gold medals in the beijing olympic and london games .

the head of the industry coordination division of the national development and reform commission said here today that overcapacity in steel is a global problem .
in recent years , china &apos;s capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average level , but also higher than the united states and europe and other countries and regions .
our country has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity , and the effectiveness is gradually emerging .
the director pointed out that the central committee of the state council attaches great importance to the global problem of overcapacity .
departments , regions actively implement the state council deployment , serious work , this year to reduce crude steel production capacity of about 45 million tons .
from china &apos;s national conditions , china does not encourage steel exports , on the contrary , also take a series of practical measures to control the export of steel .
the person in charge stressed that the international trade in steel products is essentially market behavior , which is based on the demand of the importing country and the consumers &apos; independent choice after considering the cost ratio of products .
the implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the global steel industry development problems , on the contrary , will only cause further impact on the international trade order .
when it comes to debt , the person in charge stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity .
because of the large scale of the iron and steel enterprise assets , involving a wide range , some enterprises debt relationship is complex , if improper disposal , it is possible to trigger regional risk .
according to the person in charge , in recent years , with the economic downward pressure increased , the overall social demand gradually weakened , some industry capacity utilization decreased , the production and operation of enterprises increased .
some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment , production and operation is difficult or even close to collapse , but by some institutional mechanism constraints , to market-oriented exit obstacles more , become &quot; zombie enterprises . &quot;
the existence of such enterprises distorts the market signal , reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization , increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a fair competition market environment .
the main cause of the losses is the same as the global steel industry &apos;s woes – sluggish market demand and low capacity utilization .
china mainly adopts market mechanism , economic means and rule by law , the government mainly completes the work of reveals and social stability and ensures fair and impartial market order .
the person in charge stressed that the next step , we must unswervingly continue to work on capacity to ensure that 5 years to complete the resolution of 100 million seate 5 million tons of crude steel target task .

future of the portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power supply contract
as the factory-powered power company disclosed a factory owners would terminate a supply contract that would invalidate all supply contracts , the portland aluminium smelter in victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant are facing an uncertain future .
the move comes after the victorian government decided not to continue to subsidize factory operations .
the 20-year fixed subsidy will expire in november .
2000 workers at alcoa &apos;s portland plant may face unemployment .
as soon as the factory closes , there may be as many as 2000 people directly or indirectly unemployed .
and because the plant uses about 10 % of all of victoria &apos;s electricity output , it may also have a ripple effect .
alcoa closed the hanry kok smelter in 2014 , leading to the closure of last year &apos;s anglesey power plant .
alcoa &apos;s portland smelter is currently losing money and facing a risk of closure .
the move comes after a forecast for the factory in the next few years , initially because of the strength of the australian dollar and , more recently , the price of the factory &apos;s products .
agl through the latrobe valley old eyang power plant to provide electricity for the large aluminium smelter , which predicts that three other factory owners will also terminate their agreement .
the largest shareholder in the plant is a joint venture between alcoa and alumina , while china &apos;s citic group and japan &apos;s marunouchi company also hold a small stake .
&quot; agl expects the portland plant to continue to operate , which means the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand , &quot; the joint venture said .
agl said the contracts were &quot; hedging contracts &quot; that should have been in force since november 2016 .
the termination period of the contract is 12 months , so they will terminate in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , agl still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal year 2017 , &quot; the power company said .
any revenue impact on agl from the fiscal year 2018 is now a bullish outlook for wholesale electricity prices in the futures market .
agl said the company had reduced its contract value by $ 187 million in &quot; ending activity expectations &quot; .
alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts &quot; will not affect alcoa &apos;s ability to operate the smelter or to guarantee its power supply . &quot;
the us company said it signed a 20-year contract with old eyang in 2010 , which would have come into effect in november this year , but the company did not explain why the contract was withdrawn .
analysts caution about whether the tomago plant in victoria &apos;s portland smelter and near nksr will be closed because of the industry &apos;s dire economic situation .
in response to analysts &apos; comments earlier this week , agl operations director stephen mickelson said portland &apos;s electricity consumption reached about 600 megawatts a year , and the tomago plant reached about 900 megawatts .
if two factories shut down , the demand for electricity market will be greatly reduced .
&quot; it &apos;s not good news for us as a power company , &quot; he says .
community law center shuts 160,000 people out every year
more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are shut out of the community law center each year . the service is already overstretched and now faces further cuts .
in queensland , three out of every five persons were rejected in the search for free legal advice and agency services , most of them elderly , migrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who did not have the resources to fight unjust evictions .
the lack of funding for community legal services has already exceeded the limit and now faces further capital cuts .
the federal government &apos;s funding for these legal centres will be reduced by another 30 % per year since june .
james farrell , head of the queensland community law center , said thousands of people were turned away every year according to the latest national community association law center investigation report .
mr farrell says the situation will only get worse if the federal government does not change the existing decision .
&quot; the queensland community law center is chronically underfunded , which means thousands of people will not be able to get the essential services they need , &quot; he said .
people who need to stay away from violence , those who are burdened with huge debts , families that are falling apart , and squeezed workers face legal problems , and the report shows that they are unable to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut back 30 % of its funding since june 2017 , which means thousands of vulnerable groups in queensland will be forced to face complex legal problems without help .
we call on the attorney-general and queensland congressman george brandis to withdraw the money-cutting decisions immediately so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal problems .
last year , the state promised to raise legal aid funds to the national average .
attention must now be paid to the needs of community law centres and their corresponding communities , and the bai government must also devote itself to this important work .

britain must deliver olympic spirit and expand heathrow airport
heathrow will also bring dynamism and prosperity to our communities , london and the country as a whole .
for me , this is heathrow &apos;s charm , just as we did our best to ensure that our country and region benefited from these events at the 2012 london olympics .
the olympics have benefited stratford and the east side .
and we will create opportunities for the local people and businesses around heathrow to benefit the region again .
as far as our local community is concerned , we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and leave the young people around the airport jobless .
just before the 2012 london olympics , some people thought heathrow &apos;s expansion was too big .
i was told that britain would not be ready for the olympics and that we would lose face all over the world .
sceptics are wrong about the 2012 olympics , and their suspicions of heathrow will prove wrong .
while there will always be hurdles to overcome , heathrow is tackling every a of the problems it faces .
like the olympics , heathrow is a infrastructure project for most people rather than a few .
the expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and bring in 211 billion of pounds of economic growth , leaving a technology and employment fortune around the airport and across the uk .
we have an excellent heathrow project team . the team has completed a £ 11 billion bn infrastructure investment project on time and within budget , including the t5 terminal of the world &apos;s best airport terminal for five consecutive years and the t2 terminal between two of the world &apos;s busiest runways .
now they are preparing to build a third runway with a private investment of £ 16 billion .
britain successfully hosted the 2012 london olympics , and i believe the heathrow airport expansion will be a huge success .
now is the time for us to deliver the olympic spirit and expand heathrow , so that we can escort our future and create a wealth of technology and employment that prides the whole of britain .
lord paul dayton is the chairman of the heathrow airport board and former british finance counsellor
a women killed and killed on swiss highway
the victim lay on the motorway at midnight .
the woman who tried to commit suicide was run over by several cars on the motorway early in the morning of thursday . police are now looking for witnesses .
the accident happened on the a1 highway near vaud / waadt in early thursday .
vaud / waadt police said a women were &quot; hopelessly &quot; lying on the road in the middle of the night and were run over by cars .
the victim was a 49-year-old swiss woman whose behaviour was clearly suicidal . she was run over by several cars , including a lorry .
the woman died on the spot .
police said a number of drivers had been investigated , but some of the pilots were still not confirmed . police are now appealing to them and witnesses to the incident for investigation .
gillers hoff steiter , a lawyer for the geneva tribune , indicated that criminal investigations had been initiated and that this was a routine process of such incidents .
but it is not yet known whether there will be drivers facing charges .
is it possible to avoid collisions ?
&quot; it will be determined by the prosecutor , &quot; steiter said .
according to the results of two similar cases in the past five years , drivers will not be liable .
both cases were caused by the fact that someone had taken to the motorway late at night , according to the report . the final verdict was that the pilot could not have expected pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight .
last year , a police officer was charged with negligence for death , alleging that in august 2014 , she hit a man and died on the a1 highway near payer .
the court learned that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and crossing the road .
after the investigation , the judge said that the woman policeman &apos;s driving was perfectly legal and that the man appeared on the road &quot; completely unexpected and unpredictable &quot; , and the policewoman later dialed the emergency call .
anyone who can provide information about the accident near the thursday moore day should call 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 contact police .
nasa climate model : venus was once fit for human habitation
according to nasa &apos;s new climate model , venus has been fitted for human habitation .
scientists at nasa &apos;s goddard space institute have developed a model to explore the past of venus , which uses tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists .
the model is used to determine whether venus , which has high surface temperatures , no water and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , has ever had a similar earth-like environment .
earlier , scientists believed that venus &apos; rotation was slower because of its thicker atmosphere .
but the latest simulations suggest that venus may have had a thinner , earth-like atmosphere and at that time rotated at a slower rate .
the model also shows the early terrain of venus .
venus may have more dry areas than earth , but there has been enough water and geographical changes to nurture life and prevent rapid evaporation .
in the early days , the sun shone on venus 30 % brighter than the earth .
&quot; in the model simulations of the goddard space institute , venus &apos;s slow rotation has made its side of the daytime time nearly two months , &quot; said antoni del genio , a scientist at the goddard space institute , at a news conference .
this warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds , which are like an umbrella that blocks most of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result of the simulation is that the average weather temperature of venus is actually a few degrees lower than the current earth .
the model simulates the evolution of venus similar to that previously speculated by planetary scientists .
although there may have been life on venus , venus has been exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet rays in the course of billions of years .
the oceans on the planet evaporate and the water vapor is burned out by ultraviolet rays .
as hydrogen escapes , it leaves only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and a lethal greenhouse gas effect , which forms what we know today about venus .
the researchers published the results of the new venus climate model in the journal geophysical research newsletter .

shell has cut thousands of of its staff and announced plans to shut down 10 of its oil and gas facilities because it needs to streamline its operations after it merged with british gas group , a uk energy company .
energy companies are under pressure from a drop in crude oil prices and the uk &apos;s decision to take off europe in june .
dave anderson , a member of the scottish parliament , met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labor dispute in the north sea generation .
he says the north sea is crucial to the region &apos;s economy .
&quot; in the north sea and across the country , we need an economy that serves the majority rather than the few , &quot; dave said in a statement .
the new north sea project was expected to spend no more than $ 1.4 billion in 2016 , while the average project expenditure in the past five years amounted to about $ 7 billion .
kepler measures the rotational speed of a star in a pleiades cluster
the latest mission of the kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete star rotation rate in the pleiades .
the new data are helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster have different rotational velocities and the correlation between the rotation cycle and the planet &apos;s composition .
&quot; we hope to further understand the relationship between stellar mass , age , and even the history of the solar system by comparing our results with other clusters , &quot; said luca rebul , a researcher at the center for infrared processing and analysis at the california institute of technology in pasadena .
the pleiades is 445 light-years from earth .
many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and have just reached adulthood .
they reach the highest rotational speed in their lifetimes .
at the highest rotational speed , these mature stars shoot a large number of stellar winds .
when these stellar winds travel through the magnetic field of a star , they can produce a braking effect on the star .
as the age of the star increases , its rotational speed slows down .
kepler measures the rotational velocities of the stars by tracking the time that a recognizable stellar sunspot ( like sunspots ) appears .
the latest rotational velocity datasets show that the larger stars have a slower rotation rate than the smaller stars .
raible compares a star to a dancer , and the larger dancer spins slower than the smaller dancer .
&quot; in the &apos; ballet &apos; of the pleiades , we found that stars with slower rotation tend to be of greater mass , and the fastest-spinning stars tend to be the lightest stars , &quot; raible said .
because the pleiades cluster is close to each other , it can serve as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar mass with rotational velocities .
&quot; the pleiades has laid the groundwork for a two-way spin theory model for young and aging stars , &quot; raible said .
we still have a lot of knowledge about how stars , when and why they slow their rotation and &quot; put away their own dancing shoes . &quot;
in three new papers , raible and her colleagues elaborated on their latest analysis of the rotational speed of the pleiades . these three papers will soon be published in the journal of the day literature .
south lake park water management section chief zheng jianjun introduction , south lake bottom depths of more than 10 meters , do not know the situation of the sewer , very likely to occur dangerous .
